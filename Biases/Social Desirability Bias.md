# 1. ELI5

Social desirability bias is when you tell people what you think they want to hear instead of what you really think. It's like when your mom asks if you like her new haircut and you say "it's beautiful!" even if you think it looks funny, because you don't want to hurt her feelings.

# 2. Recognizing the Bias

- **People-pleasing answers**: You find yourself agreeing with others just to avoid conflict
- **Exaggerated positives**: You overstate your good qualities or achievements
- **Minimized negatives**: You downplay your flaws, mistakes, or controversial opinions
- **Audience adaptation**: Your answers change depending on who's listening
- **Self-censorship**: You hold back honest opinions that might be unpopular
- **Image management**: You carefully craft responses to maintain a positive impression

# 3. How Bias Shows Up

**Job Interviews**: Candidates claim they "love working in teams" and "never miss deadlines" even if they prefer working alone and have been late on projects before.

**Family Gatherings**: You tell your relatives you're "doing great" in your career and "love your new city" even if you're struggling professionally and feeling lonely.

**Financial Discussions**: People lie about their income, spending habits, or investment success to appear more financially sophisticated than they really are.

**Social Media**: Users post only the highlights of their lives - vacations, achievements, happy moments - creating an unrealistic picture of constant success and happiness.

# 4. Quick Test or Checklist

**Do you experience social desirability bias?**

- Do you find yourself agreeing with opinions you don't actually believe?
- Do you ever lie about your accomplishments to impress others?
- Do you avoid sharing negative information about yourself?
- Do your answers change based on who's asking the questions?
- Do you worry more about being liked than being honest?
- Do you find yourself exaggerating your positive qualities?

# 5. How to Counteract

ü§î **Practice authenticity**: Remind yourself that honesty builds deeper connections than temporary approval

üìù **Anonymous feedback**: Provide honest input through anonymous channels when possible

 **Pause before answering**: Take a moment to consider your true response before speaking

üí¨ **Use "I" statements**: Frame honest opinions as personal perspectives rather than absolute truths

Ô∏è **Create safe spaces**: Foster environments where honesty is valued over politeness

**Embrace vulnerability**: Recognize that admitting imperfections builds trust and relatability

**Seek objective measures**: Use data and facts instead of subjective claims when discussing performance or achievements
