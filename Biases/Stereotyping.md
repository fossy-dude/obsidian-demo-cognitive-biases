# 1. ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5)

Imagine you have a box of crayons, and you think all the blue crayons must be good at drawing oceans just because they're blue. Stereotyping is like that - when we think everyone in a group is the same just because they share something like where they're from, what they look like, or what they like.

But people are more like snowflakes than crayons - each one is unique and different, even if they seem similar at first!

# 2. Recognizing the Bias

Stereotyping Happens when We Make Automatic Assumptions about People Based on Their Group Membership rather than Their Individual Qualities

**Warning Signs You're Stereotyping:**
- **"All [group] people are..."** - Using absolute statements about entire groups
- **Assuming skills/traits** - Believing someone has certain qualities just because of their background
- **Surprise bias** - Being shocked when someone doesn't fit your stereotype ("You're so articulate!")
- **Limited expectations** - Assuming someone can't do something because of their group identity
- **"Typical..." comments** - Dismissing individual behavior as "just like them"
- **Group-based decisions** - Making judgments without considering individual differences

# 4. Quick Test or Checklist

**Self-Assessment Questions:**
1. Have you ever said "I'm not racist/sexist, but..." followed by a stereotype?
2. Do you find yourself surprised when someone from a particular group doesn't fit your expectations?
3. Have you ever avoided asking someone about their individual qualities because you thought you "already knew"?
4. Do you catch yourself making generalizations about groups that begin with "They always..." or "They never..."?

**The Stereotype Awareness Test:**
- Think about the last 5 people you met from different backgrounds
- Note any automatic assumptions you made about them
- Ask yourself: "Did I get to know them as individuals or just see them as group members?"

**Decision Review Checklist:**
- [ ] Before judging someone, ask: "What do I actually know about this specific person?"
- [ ] Catch yourself saying "typical" and pause to consider the individual
- [ ] When surprised by someone's behavior, examine your expectations
- [ ] Notice when you're making assumptions without evidence

# 5. How to Counteract ️

## 5.1. **Immediate Actions**

- **Pause and question** - When you notice a stereotypical thought, stop and ask "What evidence do I have for this belief about this specific person?"
- **Seek individual information** - Instead of relying on group assumptions, ask people about their personal experiences, skills, and preferences
- **Challenge automatic thoughts** - When you catch yourself stereotyping, consciously replace it with individual-focused thinking

## 5.2. **Mindset Shifts**

- **Embrace complexity** - Remind yourself that every person is a unique combination of experiences, traits, and circumstances
- **Practice curiosity** - Approach people with genuine interest in their individual stories rather than preconceived notions
- **Acknowledge bias** - Accept that everyone has stereotypes; the key is recognizing and questioning them

## 5.3. **Systematic Approaches**

- **Diverse exposure** - Intentionally seek out interactions with people from different backgrounds to build real-world experience that challenges stereotypes
- **Individual-focused evaluations** - Create systems that assess people based on their specific qualities and achievements rather than group characteristics
- **Blind processes** - When possible, use anonymous evaluations to remove group identity from decision-making

## 5.4. **Workplace Strategies**

- **Structured interviews** - Use standardized questions and evaluation criteria to reduce subjective judgments
- **Diverse hiring panels** - Include multiple perspectives to counter individual biases
- **Skills-based assessments** - Test actual abilities rather than relying on assumptions or credentials
- **Bias training** - Participate in regular unconscious bias training and discussions

## 5.5. **Daily Life Practice**

- **Travel and explore** - Expose yourself to different cultures and communities firsthand
- **Media literacy** - Consume diverse media that portrays people as complex individuals
- **Active listening** - Practice hearing people's unique stories rather than filtering them through stereotypes
- **Teach others** - Help friends and family recognize their own stereotypical thinking patterns

> **Remember**: The goal isn't to pretend differences don't exist, but to recognize that group membership tells us very little about any specific individual. Each person deserves to be seen and understood as the unique human being they are.
