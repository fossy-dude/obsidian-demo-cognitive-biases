# 1. ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5)

Imagine you pick the red crayon to draw a picture, but later you see the blue one would have been better. Instead of admitting you made a mistake, you tell yourself "Red is actually the perfect color for this!" and remember your choice as being smarter than it really was.

Choice-supportive bias is when your brain tricks you into thinking the decisions you made were better than they actually were, just because YOU made them!

# 2. Recognizing the Bias

Choice-supportive Bias is Our Tendency to Remember past Choices as Better than They Actually Were, Selectively Focusing on Positive Aspects and Downplaying Negative Ones

**Key Warning Signs You're Experiencing This Bias:**

**Internal Thought Patterns:**
- "I'm so glad I chose X, it was definitely the right decision"
- "Looking back, my choice was much better than the alternatives"
- "That other option wouldn't have worked out anyway"
- "My decision-making is usually pretty good"

**Behavioral Indicators:**
- You consistently defend past decisions even when presented with evidence they weren't optimal
- You focus on the benefits of your choice while minimizing the drawbacks
- You feel the need to justify decisions you made, even to yourself
- You notice your memory of why you chose something has become more positive over time

**️ Emotional Red Flags:**
- Feeling defensive when someone questions your past choices
- Experiencing regret but quickly talking yourself out of it
- Needing to convince yourself that you made the right call
- Feeling uncomfortable admitting mistakes or poor decisions

# 4. Quick Test or Checklist

## 4.1. **Self-Assessment Questions**

**Core Bias Detection:**
1. When you think about a major purchase you made, do you find yourself focusing mainly on the benefits while minimizing the drawbacks?
2. If someone asks about your career choices, do you tend to highlight the positive outcomes while downplaying the challenges?
3. Have you ever found yourself defending a decision you made years ago, even when presented with evidence it wasn't optimal?
4. When comparing your choices to alternatives you didn't choose, do you tend to remember your choice as clearly superior?
5. Do you notice that your reasons for making a particular decision have become more positive and sophisticated over time?

**Advanced Detection Scenarios:**
6. **The Car Purchase Test**: You bought a car that's had some mechanical issues. When friends ask about it, do you say "It's been great overall" while the check engine light is on?
7. **The Job Decision Dilemma**: You turned down a job offer for your current position. When you hear the other company is doing well, do you immediately think "But I wouldn't have been happy there anyway"?
8. **The Relationship Reflection**: You ended a relationship that wasn't working. Do you tend to remember only the problems and forget the good times, to validate your decision?

**Scoring Your Choice-Supportive Bias:**

- **0-2 "yes" answers**: Low bias - You're generally realistic about your past decisions
- **3-4 "yes" answers**: Moderate bias - You sometimes defend past choices beyond what's warranted
- **5-8 "yes" answers**: High bias - You frequently reshape memories to justify your decisions

## 4.2. **Behavioral Checklist**

**Monitor These Patterns:**
- [ ] I catch myself making excuses for decisions when questioned
- [ ] I feel defensive when someone criticizes a choice I made
- [ ] I tend to remember my decisions as wiser than they actually were
- [ ] I focus on the positive aspects of my choices while ignoring negatives
- [ ] I need to convince myself (and others) that I made the right call

** Quick Reality Checks:**

**The Counterfactual Test**: Ask yourself "If someone else had made this exact same decision, would I evaluate it the same way?"

**The Documentation Challenge**: Look at notes or records you made when you made the decision. Do they match your current recollection of why you chose what you did?

**The Perspective Switch**: Imagine advising someone who made the same decision you did. Would you give them the same glowing review you give yourself?

**Remember**: Everyone experiences this bias to some degree. The goal is awareness, not perfection. Use these tests to catch yourself reshaping your memories!
