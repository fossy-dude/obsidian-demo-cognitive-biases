# 1. ELI5

The Availability Heuristic is when we judge how likely something is based on how easily we can remember examples of it happening. If something comes to mind quickly, we think it's more common or important than it actually is. It's like thinking shark attacks are super common because you just watched a scary movie about sharks, even though they're actually very rare.

# 2. Recognizing the Bias

- You base decisions on the first examples that come to mind
- Recent news stories heavily influence your perception of risk
- You overestimate the likelihood of dramatic events (plane crashes, lottery wins)
- You judge entire groups based on a few memorable encounters
- You think problems are more common when you've just experienced them
- Media coverage makes you believe certain events happen more often than they do
- You recall vivid, emotional memories more easily than routine experiences
- You assume patterns from small samples of recent experiences

# 3. How Bias Shows Up

**At Work:**
- Hiring managers reject candidates from certain schools because they remember one bad hire from there
- Teams avoid new technologies after one high-profile project failure
- Leaders make budget cuts in areas where they recently heard complaints
- Performance reviews are skewed by recent events rather than overall yearly performance

**Daily Life:**
- Avoiding air travel after hearing about a plane crash on the news
- Buying insurance immediately after hearing about a friend's accident
- Choosing restaurants based on the last review you read online
- Worrying about crime after watching local news reports

**Financial Decisions:**
- Selling stocks during market dips because bad news is fresh in memory
- Avoiding certain investments after hearing one horror story
- Overestimating the likelihood of winning the lottery during jackpot weeks
- Making insurance decisions based on recent disasters rather than actual statistics

**Personal Relationships:**
- Judging dating prospects based on your most recent relationship experience
- Avoiding certain social activities after one bad experience
- Making parenting decisions based on recent news stories about child safety

# 4. Quick Test or Checklist

Ask yourself these three questions when making decisions:

1. **Am I basing this decision mainly on what I can easily remember?** Consider whether recent or vivid experiences are overshadowing the bigger picture.
2. **What examples am I NOT thinking of?** Actively seek out data, statistics, or experiences that contradict your immediate gut reaction.
3. **Is this memory representative of the whole situation?** Question whether your most memorable examples are actually typical or just dramatic outliers.

# 5. How to Counteract

**Seek Out Data:**
- Look up actual statistics before making risk-based decisions
- Research base rates and historical trends rather than relying on headlines
- Use structured decision-making frameworks that include multiple data points

**‚è∏Ô∏è Pause and Reflect:**
- Wait 24-48 hours before making important decisions influenced by recent events
- Ask yourself: "What was I thinking about this topic last month?"
- Keep a decision journal to track patterns in your thinking over time

** Diversify Your Information Sources:**
- Actively seek out different perspectives and experiences
- Ask multiple people for their experiences, not just the most vocal ones
- Read beyond headlines and look for comprehensive reports

**üìù Use Checklists and Systems:**
- Create standardized evaluation criteria for recurring decisions
- Use pro/con lists that include both recent and historical factors
- Implement "devil's advocate" thinking to challenge your initial impressions

** Get Outside Perspective:**
- Ask trusted advisors what they think before sharing your initial opinion
- Consult with people who have different recent experiences than you
- Use team decision-making processes that require multiple viewpoints
