# 1. ELI5

The law of triviality is when people spend way too much time discussing small, unimportant details while ignoring big, important decisions that really matter. It's like a committee spending hours arguing about what color to paint the bike shed while barely discussing whether they should buy a new bike at all. This bias makes us focus on what's easy to understand instead of what's actually important.

# 2. Recognizing the Bias

- **Minor obsession**: Getting stuck on small details while major decisions go unexamined
- **Comfortable complexity**: Focusing on trivial topics that everyone can understand
- **Displacement activity**: Using minor debates to avoid addressing difficult issues
- **Time distortion**: Spending disproportionate time on low-impact decisions
- **False sense of control**: Belving that mastering trivial details means you're managing the big picture
- **Expertise avoidance**: Steering conversations toward areas where everyone feels qualified

# 3. How Bias Shows Up

**Workplace**: A corporate committee spends three hours debating the font choice for a new company logo while allocating only fifteen minutes to discuss the million-dollar marketing budget that will determine the campaign's success.

**Daily Life**: A family spends weeks arguing about paint colors for their new home while rushing through decisions about mortgage terms and neighborhood safety that will affect their lives for decades.

**Social Policy**: City council members engage in heated debates about park bench placement while giving minimal consideration to major infrastructure projects that could transform community transportation and economic development.

**Financial Planning**: Someone spends hours researching which credit card offers the best 2% cashback while ignoring fundamental questions about their investment strategy and retirement savings rate.

# 4. Quick Test or Checklist

**Do you experience the law of triviality?**

- Do you find yourself spending more time on minor details than major decisions?
- In meetings, do trivial topics generate more discussion than important ones?
- Do you focus on what's easy to understand rather than what's most important?
- Do you use minor decisions to procrastinate on addressing bigger issues?
- Are you more comfortable discussing surface-level details than complex fundamentals?

# 5. How to Counteract

üìö **Prioritization frameworks**: Use tools like Eisenhower Matrix to distinguish urgent vs. important matters

ü§î **Impact assessment**: Before diving into details, ask "how much will this really affect the outcome?"

**Time boxing**: Allocate meeting time proportionally to decision importance, not topic complexity

üí¨ **Agenda setting**: Always tackle the most important decisions first when people are fresh and focused

 **Perspective shifting**: Regularly zoom out and ask "are we focusing on bike sheds or bikes?"

üìù **Decision hierarchy**: Create clear frameworks that rank decisions by their potential impact

 **Triviality alerts**: Learn to recognize when discussions are veering into unimportant territory

**Consequence analysis**: For each decision point, identify who will be affected and for how long
