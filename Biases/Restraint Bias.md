Restraint bias is like when you think you can eat just one potato chip, but then you end up eating the whole bag anyway. It's when people believe they have more self-control than they actually do, leading them to overestimate their ability to resist temptations and avoid getting hooked on things.

- **Underestimating addiction risk**: Thinking you won't get addicted to substances or behaviors that are commonly addictive
- **Past pattern ignorance**: Ignoring your own history of failed attempts at self-control
- **Environmental optimism**: Believing you can handle tempting situations without preparation
- **Planning fallacy**: Creating ambitious self-control plans without considering real-world challenges

# 4. Quick Test or Checklist

## 4.1. **Restraint Bias Self-Assessment**

**Ask yourself these questions when facing temptations or making self-control commitments:**

- **"Have I successfully resisted this temptation in the past, or do I have a history of giving in?"**
- **"Am I making exceptions for myself that I wouldn't allow for others in similar situations?"**
- **"What specific strategies am I using to maintain self-control, or am I just relying on willpower alone?"**
- **"If someone asked me to bet money on my ability to resist, would I take that bet?"**

# 5. How to Counteract

## 5.1. ️ **Practical Strategies to Overcome Restraint Bias**

### 5.1.1. **1. Environmental Design**

- **Implementation**: Structure your environment to make good behaviors easy and bad behaviors difficult

### 5.1.2. **2. Pre-commitment Strategies**

- **Implementation**: Make binding decisions in advance when your willpower is strong
- **Why it works**: Removes the need for in-the-moment self-control by creating automatic constraints
