# 1. ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5)

üë• Imagine you love ice cream and think everyone else must love it too! Assumed similarity bias is when you believe other people are just like you - they like the same things, think the same way, and have the same opinions as you do. It's like assuming everyone's favorite color is blue just because yours is!

# 2. Recognizing the Bias

**Warning signs that you're falling for the assumed similarity bias:**

- **Surprise reactions** - Being shocked when someone disagrees with you or has different preferences
- **Mind reading attempts** - Thinking you know what others want or think without asking them
- **Gift selection struggles** - Giving people presents you'd want rather than what they'd actually enjoy
- **Projection patterns** - Assuming others share your values, beliefs, and priorities
- **Conversation domination** - Talking mostly about topics that interest you, assuming others care too
- **Decision making for others** - Making choices for people based on what you'd prefer
- **Judgment triggers** - Thinking others are "wrong" when they differ from your perspective
- **Teamwork conflicts** - Expecting teammates to work and communicate exactly like you do

# 3. How Bias Shows Up

## 3.1. Workplace Scenarios

- **Management style** - A manager who works long hours assumes their team wants to work weekends too
- **Meeting preferences** - Someone who loves brainstorming assumes everyone enjoys chaotic creative sessions
- **Communication styles** - Direct communicators assuming everyone appreciates blunt feedback
- **Work-life balance** - People who prioritize career over family thinking their team feels the same
- **Problem-solving approaches** - Logical thinkers assuming everyone processes information the same way
- **Recognition preferences** - Public praise lovers assuming everyone wants to be celebrated in front of others

## 3.2. Daily Life Examples

- **Restaurant choices** - Picking spicy restaurants for friends who prefer mild food
- **Movie selections** - Choosing action films for family movie night assuming everyone enjoys them
- **Social activities** - Planning hiking trips for friends who prefer relaxing at home
- **Home d√©cor** - Decorating shared spaces according to your taste without consulting others
- **Food preparation** - Cooking meals you enjoy without considering others' dietary preferences
- **Vacation planning** - Planning adventurous trips for family members who prefer relaxation

## 3.3. Financial Decision Making

- **Investment advice** - Recommending aggressive investments to risk-averse friends
- **Spending priorities** - Assuming others value the same things you do when allocating money
- **Gift giving** - Buying expensive gifts for people who prefer practical or homemade items
- **Charitable giving** - Supporting causes you care about without understanding others' priorities
- **Financial planning** - Creating budgets based on your values rather than family needs

## 3.4. Social Relationships

- **Friendship expectations** - Assuming friends want to communicate as frequently as you do
- **Relationship styles** - Expecting partners to show affection the same way you do
- **Family dynamics** - Thinking your family members share your opinions on major life decisions
- **Social media behavior** - Posting content you find interesting, assuming others will too
- **Conflict resolution** - Using approaches that work for you but not for others

# 4. Quick Test or Checklist

**Self-assessment questions to identify assumed similarity bias:**

1. **Projection check**: "When was the last time I was surprised that someone didn't like something I love?"
2. **Decision pattern**: "How often do I make choices for others without asking their preferences?"
3. **Communication style**: "Do I assume others process information the same way I do?"
4. **Gift giving**: "When I buy gifts for others, am I really buying what I would want?"
5. **Social planning**: "Do I plan activities based on what I enjoy rather than what the group might prefer?"

**Score yourself**: 0-1 "yes" = low bias, 2-3 "yes" = moderate bias, 4-5 "yes" = high bias

# 5. How to Counteract

Ô∏è **Strategies to overcome assumed similarity bias:**

**Remember**: The world is rich and diverse precisely because people are different. Assuming everyone is like you isn't just inaccurate - it prevents you from learning, growing, and building meaningful connections with others. The beauty of humanity lies in our differences, not our similarities.

**Key insight**: When you assume others are like you, you miss the opportunity to learn something new. Every person you meet has a unique perspective that can expand your understanding of the world.
