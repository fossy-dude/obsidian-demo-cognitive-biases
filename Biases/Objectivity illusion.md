# 1. ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5)

Imagine you're playing a game where everyone wears different colored glasses. You think your glasses are "normal" and show you the real world, but everyone else's glasses make them see things wrong. In reality, everyone's glasses change how they see things - including yours!

The objectivity illusion is thinking you see the world just as it really is, while believing other people are biased. It's like wearing invisible glasses and not knowing you have them on!

# 2. Recognizing the Bias

Objectivity illusion is the tendency to believe we see the world objectively and without bias, while assuming others' perspectives are distorted by their biases.

**Key Warning Signs You're Experiencing This Bias:**

**Internal Thought Patterns:**
- "I'm just being objective here" (while dismissing others' views as biased)
- "I don't have a dog in this fight" (claiming neutrality while having clear preferences)
- "The facts clearly show..." (presenting your interpretation as undeniable truth)
- "I can see both sides" (while clearly favoring one perspective)

**Behavioral Indicators:**
- You dismiss alternative viewpoints as "biased" or "emotionally driven"
- You claim to be "just stating facts" when expressing opinions
- You become defensive when someone suggests you might be biased
- You use phrases like "logically" or "obviously" to support your position
- You assume people who disagree with you simply haven't thought things through

**Ô∏è Emotional Red Flags:**
- Feeling frustrated when others don't accept your "objective" analysis
- Experiencing surprise when someone questions your neutrality
- Having a strong sense that you're "the voice of reason" in discussions
- Feeling intellectually superior to those who see things differently
- Becoming annoyed when bias is discussed (as if it doesn't apply to you)

# 4. Quick Test or Checklist

## 4.1. **Self-Assessment Questions**

**Core Bias Detection:**
1. When someone disagrees with you, is your first thought "they're biased" rather than "they might have a valid point"?
2. Do you frequently use phrases like "I'm just being objective" or "I don't have a stake in this"?
3. When presented with evidence that contradicts your view, do you question the source rather than reconsider your position?
4. Do you believe you're less influenced by media, advertising, or peer pressure than most people?

**Advanced Detection Scenarios:**
5. **The Political Test**: If someone disagrees with your political views, do you assume they're misinformed or emotionally driven rather than having different values or experiences?
6. **The Expertise Paradox**: Do you dismiss experts who disagree with you as "biased" or "part of the establishment" while embracing those who confirm your views?
7. **The Feedback Filter**: When receiving criticism, do you focus on the critic's perceived biases rather than the content of their feedback?
8. **The Neutrality Claim**: In conflicts involving people you care about, do you claim to be neutral while clearly favoring one side?

**Scoring Your Objectivity Illusion:**

- **0-2 "yes" answers**: Low bias - You're generally aware of your own subjectivity
- **3-4 "yes" answers**: Moderate bias - You should be more mindful of claiming objectivity
- **5-8 "yes" answers**: High bias - You frequently fall for the objectivity illusion

## 4.2. **Behavioral Checklist**

**Monitor These Patterns:**
- [ ] I catch myself saying "I'm just being objective" during disagreements
- [ ] I dismiss people who disagree with me as "biased" or "emotional"
- [ ] I believe I'm less influenced by advertising or media than others
- [ ] I use phrases like "logically" or "obviously" to support my opinions
- [ ] I'm surprised when someone suggests I might be biased

** Quick Reality Checks:**

**The Bias Test**: Before claiming objectivity, ask: "What biases might I have that I'm not aware of?"

**The Perspective Challenge**: "Would I still think this way if I had different life experiences, values, or information?"

**The Humble Question**: "What information or perspectives am I missing that could change my view?"

**The Double Standard**: "Do I apply the same 'bias detector' to myself that I apply to others?"

**Remember**: Everyone has biases - the goal isn't to eliminate them (impossible!) but to remain aware of them and stay open to other perspectives.
