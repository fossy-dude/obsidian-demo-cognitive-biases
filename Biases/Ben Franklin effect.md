# 1. ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5)

Imagine you help your friend build a LEGO castle. After you help them, you start thinking "I must really like building with LEGOs with them!" and you want to help them even more next time.

The Ben Franklin effect is like that - when we do something nice for someone, our brain decides "I must really like this person!" and we end up liking them more and wanting to help them again, instead of the other way around!

# 2. Recognizing the Bias

The Ben Franklin effect occurs when we grow to like people more after doing them favors, rather than feeling resentful about the effort expended.

**Warning Signs of the Ben Franklin Effect:**
- **"I must really like them"** - Justifying doing favors by convincing yourself you like the person
- **Increasing investment** - Finding yourself doing more and more for someone you initially felt neutral about
- **Cognitive dissonance** - Feeling uncomfortable when you've helped someone you don't like, then changing your opinion to reduce the discomfort
- **Post-favor rationalization** - Making excuses for why someone deserves your help after you've already helped them
- **Sudden fondness** - Developing unexpected warmth toward someone shortly after doing them a significant favor
- **"They're not so bad"** - Re-evaluating someone positively after extending effort on their behalf

# 4. Quick Test or Checklist

**Self-Assessment Questions:**
1. Have you ever found yourself liking someone more after doing them a favor, even if you didn't particularly like them before?
2. Do you catch yourself justifying extra effort for someone by thinking "they're actually pretty great"?
3. Have you ever continued helping someone beyond what was reasonable, partly because you'd already invested so much?
4. Do you notice yourself making more positive excuses for people you've helped?

**The Ben Franklin Effect Test:**
- Think about someone you've helped significantly recently
- Has your opinion of them changed since helping them?
- Would you have helped them the same amount before vs. after you started helping them?
- Do you find yourself wanting to help them again, even if it's inconvenient?

**Decision Review Checklist:**
- [ ] Before doing a significant favor, ask: "Am I doing this because I want to, or because I feel I should?"
- [ ] After helping someone, check: "Do I like them more because I helped them, or for legitimate reasons?"
- [ ] Notice when you're making excuses for someone you've helped
- [ ] Be aware of escalating commitment - are you doing more and more for this person?

# 5. How to Counteract ️

## 5.1. **Immediate Awareness**

- **Pause before helping** - Take a moment to consider your true motives before offering significant help
- **Track your feelings** - Notice when your opinion of someone changes after doing them favors
- **Question justifications** - Ask yourself: "Would I think this positively about them if I hadn't helped them?"
- **Set boundaries** - Be clear about your limits before committing to help

## 5.2. **Cognitive Strategies**

- **Pre-favor evaluation** - Rate your feelings about someone before helping them, then compare afterward
- **Seek objective criteria** - Base your continued involvement on actual compatibility and shared values, not just past investment
- **Consider reciprocity** - Notice if the relationship is balanced or if you're giving much more than you're receiving
- **Delay major commitments** - Avoid making significant investments until you've had time to evaluate the relationship objectively

## 5.3. **Systematic Approaches**

- **Favor budgeting** - Limit the time and resources you invest in new relationships until you know them better
- **Multiple perspectives** - Ask trusted friends for their objective opinion about people you're helping
- **Time-based decisions** - Make important relationship decisions after the initial post-favor glow has faded
- **Helping journal** - Keep track of who you help and how your opinions change over time

## 5.4. **Workplace Applications**

- **Structured mentorship** - Use formal programs with clear boundaries and expectations
- **Team project guidelines** - Establish clear limits on cross-functional help to prevent overcommitment
- **Performance reviews** - Evaluate relationships based on results and mutual benefit, not just effort expended
- **Professional boundaries** - Maintain appropriate limits on personal investment in work relationships
- **Peer consultation** - Discuss significant work relationship investments with colleagues before proceeding

## 5.5. **Personal Life Management**

- **Gradual investment** - Start with small favors and increase gradually as relationships prove worthy
- **Mutual benefit focus** - Look for relationships where both parties contribute and benefit
- **Self-reflection practice** - Regularly examine whether your continuing help is based on genuine connection or cognitive bias
- **Balance assessment** - Ensure your helping efforts are distributed across multiple relationships, not concentrated on a few
- **Exit strategies** - Recognize when it's appropriate to reduce or stop helping, even after significant investment

> **Remember**: The Ben Franklin effect isn't inherently bad - it can help build relationships and community. The key is awareness - use this knowledge to build genuine connections rather than being manipulated by your own cognitive biases. Help others mindfully, not automatically.

## 5.6. **Ethical Considerations**

**Using the Effect Responsibly:**
- **Don't manipulate others** - Asking for small favors to build relationships is fine, but exploiting this bias is unethical
- **Be genuine** - Use this knowledge to build authentic connections, not just to get what you want
- **Reciprocate appropriately** - If others use this effect positively with you, acknowledge and appreciate it
- **Teach awareness** - Help others understand this bias so they can make conscious choices about their relationships

**When to Be Cautious:**
- **Sales and persuasion contexts** - Be aware when others might be using this bias to influence you
- **High-stakes decisions** - Make important relationship decisions when you're not under the influence of recent favors
- **Unequal power dynamics** - Be especially careful in relationships where there's a significant power imbalance
- **Emotional vulnerability** - Recognize that you may be more susceptible to this bias when feeling lonely or insecure
