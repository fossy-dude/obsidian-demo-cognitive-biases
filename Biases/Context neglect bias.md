# 1. ELI5

Context neglect bias is when people focus only on the technical details of a problem while ignoring the human, social, and environmental factors that affect it. It's like trying to fix a broken machine without considering who uses it, where it's used, or why it broke in the first place. This bias makes us overlook important background information that could help us solve problems more effectively.

# 2. Recognizing the Bias

- **Technical tunnel vision**: Focusing exclusively on technical solutions while ignoring human factors
- **Environmental blindness**: Overlooking how physical or social surroundings affect outcomes
- **Historical amnesia**: Forgetting past events that shaped current situations
- **Cultural ignorance**: Disregarding how cultural norms and values influence behavior
- **Stakeholder oversight**: Failing to consider all people affected by decisions or systems
- **Situation discounting**: Minimizing how circumstances impact results and behaviors

# 3. How Bias Shows Up

üíº **Workplace**: A software team develops a perfect technical solution for a client's data management problem but fails to consider the employees' limited technical skills, resulting in a system that's theoretically ideal but practically unusable.

üè† **Daily Life**: Someone buys the most advanced, energy-efficient appliances for their home without considering their family's actual usage patterns and preferences, leading to underutilized expensive equipment and household frustration.

üéØ **Social Policy**: Policymakers implement a well-designed financial literacy program in low-income areas without considering local cultural attitudes toward money and banking, resulting in poor participation and wasted resources.

üí∞ **Technology Design**: Engineers create a revolutionary agricultural technology for developing countries but ignore local infrastructure limitations, climate conditions, and farming traditions, making the innovation impractical for its intended users.

# 4. Quick Test or Checklist

**Do you experience context neglect bias?**

- When solving problems, do you focus primarily on technical aspects while ignoring human factors?
- Do you implement solutions without researching the history or background of the situation?
- Do you overlook how cultural or social environments might affect your plans?
- Do you consider all stakeholders who will be impacted by your decisions?
- Do you assume that what works in one context will work the same in all contexts?

# 5. How to Counteract

üìö **Context mapping**: Before solving problems, create comprehensive maps of all relevant factors, including human, environmental, and historical elements

ü§î **Stakeholder analysis**: Identify all people affected by decisions and consider their perspectives, needs, and constraints

 **Environmental scanning**: Systematically examine the physical, social, and cultural surroundings that influence situations

üí¨ **User-centered thinking**: Always consider the end-users' context, capabilities, and limitations when designing solutions

üîÑ **Historical review**: Research past attempts and outcomes in similar situations to understand what worked and why

üìù **Cultural awareness**: Develop sensitivity to how cultural norms and values affect behavior and acceptance

‚ö° **Holistic assessment**: Use frameworks that force consideration of multiple dimensions beyond just technical aspects

üéØ **Pilot testing**: Test solutions in real-world contexts to discover overlooked contextual factors before full implementation
