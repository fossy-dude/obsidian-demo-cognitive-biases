# 1. ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5)

 Imagine your brain is like a super-fast helper that makes decisions without you even knowing! Sometimes this helper makes good choices, but sometimes it plays favorites with people based on things like their appearance, voice, or where they're from.

Unconscious bias is like having secret rules in your brain that you don't even know about! These rules can make you treat some people better than others without meaning to. It's not because you're a bad person - your brain is just trying to be helpful but sometimes gets it wrong! 🤖

## 1.1. Recognizing the Bias

️ **You might be experiencing this bias when:**

- You feel more comfortable with people who look or sound like you
- You have a "gut feeling" about someone you can't explain
- You find yourself finishing other people's sentences based on stereotypes
- You're surprised when someone doesn't fit your expectations of their group
- You make quick judgments about people before getting to know them

**Key phrases that signal unconscious bias:**
- "I don't know why, but I just don't have a good feeling about them"
- "They're not the right fit for our team culture"
- "They don't look like a [job title]"
- "I'm just going with my gut instinct"
- "Something feels off about them"

## 1.2. How It Shows Up

### 1.2.1. **Workplace Examples**

- **Hiring**: Preferring candidates with familiar names or backgrounds
- **Promotions**: Overlooking qualified people who don't fit the "leadership look"
- **Team assignments**: Giving important projects to people you feel comfortable with
- **Performance reviews**: Being harsher or more lenient based on personal comfort level
- **Meeting dynamics**: Calling more on people who remind you of yourself

### 1.2.2. **Daily Life Examples**

- **Friendships**: Naturally gravitating toward people similar to yourself
- **Service interactions**: Getting better service from people who look like you
- **Safety perceptions**: Feeling more or less safe around certain people
- **Assumptions**: Making assumptions about people's interests, abilities, or background
- **Social media**: Engaging more with content from people like you

### 1.2.3. **Financial Examples**

- **Negotiations**: Offering different salaries or prices based on unconscious preferences
- **Loans**: Being more likely to approve people who feel familiar
- **Investment advice**: Giving different guidance based on assumptions about clients
- **Retail**: Providing different levels of service based on appearance
- **Housing**: Showing different properties based on assumptions about affordability

## 1.3. Quick Test

**Scenario 1**: You're hiring for a position and two candidates have identical qualifications. One went to your alma mater, one didn't. Your tendency:
A) Feel more positively about the candidate from your school
B) Evaluate both equally based on their skills
C) Be slightly skeptical of the candidate from your school

**Scenario 2**: You meet someone with a foreign accent. Your automatic thought:
A) "I wonder where they're from and what their story is"
B) "They might be harder to understand or work with"
C) "This is an interesting person I'd like to know better"

**Scenario 3**: You need help with a technical problem. You see two people - one fits the "tech person" stereotype, one doesn't. Your instinct:
A) Ask the stereotypical tech person first
B) Ask whoever is closest or most available
C) Ask both and see who responds best

**Scenario 4**: You're walking down the street at night and see someone approaching. Your reaction:
A) Feel more or less safe based on their appearance
B) Feel the same level of caution regardless of who it is
C) Cross the street based on your gut feeling about them

### 1.4.1. **Immediate Strategies**

- **Pause and question**: "Why am I thinking this about this person?"

## 1.6. Common Types of Unconscious Bias

**Affinity bias**: Preferring people who are like us
**Confirmation bias**: Looking for evidence that confirms our beliefs
**Halo effect**: Assuming one good trait means someone is good at everything
