# 1. ELI5

Not Invented Here bias is like when a kid refuses to wear a cool superhero costume their friend suggested, insisting instead on wearing the one they picked out themselves, even though the friend's costume is actually better. It's when people or organizations reject ideas, solutions, or products just because they came from someone else, even if those ideas are actually superior to what they currently have. Your brain thinks "if we didn't create it, it can't be any good."

# 2. Recognizing the Bias

**Warning Signs in Your Thinking:**
- You immediately dismiss ideas from competitors or other departments
- You find yourself thinking "We could do better than that" without analyzing the actual merits
- You feel resistance to adopting solutions that weren't developed in-house
- You overemphasize the flaws in external ideas while downplaying their benefits
- You believe your team's approach is superior simply because it's "yours"

**Physical & Behavioral Indicators:**
- Getting defensive when someone suggests an external solution
- Spending excessive time trying to replicate existing external solutions internally
- Rejecting industry standards or best practices because "we do things differently"
- Feeling a sense of pride in doing everything "from scratch"
- Skeptical body language when presented with outside ideas or suggestions

# 3. How Bias Shows Up

## 3.1. **Workplace Scenarios**

- A company spends millions developing their own project management software instead of using proven industry-standard tools
- A research team ignores findings from other institutions, insisting on conducting their own studies to "verify" the results
- A marketing department rejects a successful campaign strategy from a competitor and tries to reinvent it
- An IT team builds custom solutions for common problems instead of using reliable off-the-shelf software
- Managers dismiss employee suggestions because "if it was a good idea, someone would have thought of it already"

## 3.2. **Daily Life Examples**

- You refuse to use a recipe recommended by a friend, insisting on creating your own version that turns out worse
- You ignore health advice from doctors or experts, preferring to "figure it out yourself"
- You avoid learning from others' mistakes, insisting on making your own to "learn the hard way"
- You reject life hacks or productivity tips because you didn't discover them yourself
- You struggle with a problem for hours before finally looking up the solution that was easily available

## 3.3. **Financial Decision Making**

- An investor avoids proven investment strategies because they didn't develop the system themselves
- A business owner refuses to adopt industry-standard accounting practices, creating their own complicated system
- You ignore financial advice from experts, preferring to "trust your gut" even when data contradicts you
- A company rejects acquisition offers or partnerships because they want to "do it all themselves"
- You avoid using budgeting apps or tools, insisting on creating your own spreadsheets that are less effective

## 3.4. **Technology & Innovation Impact**

- Software developers rewrite existing libraries and frameworks instead of using proven solutions
- Companies reject open-source technologies in favor of developing proprietary alternatives
- Design teams ignore established UX patterns, creating confusing interfaces that are "unique"
- Organizations resist adopting cloud services or SaaS solutions, maintaining expensive on-premise infrastructure
- Individuals dismiss popular apps or tools because they want to use something more obscure or "different"

# 4. Quick Test or Checklist

**Check yourself with these questions:**

ü§î **When presented with external solutions, do you:**

- Immediately look for flaws or reasons why it won't work for your specific situation?
- Feel a sense of resistance or defensiveness about adopting outside ideas?
- Assume you could create something better without analyzing the existing solution?

**Cost-Benefit Reality Check:**
- Are you spending more time/money recreating something than it would cost to adopt?
- Are you rejecting proven solutions because they weren't created in-house?
- Do you objectively compare the features and benefits, or just the source?

‚öñÔ∏è **Pride vs. Progress Assessment:**

- Is your resistance based on genuine concerns or on wanting to do it yourself?
- Are you prioritizing originality over effectiveness?
- Would you adopt this solution if you had created it yourself?

# 5. How to Counteract

## 5.1. **Immediate Strategies**

- **Separate Source from Solution**: Evaluate ideas based on their merits, not their origin
- **Practice "Steal Like an Artist"**: Look at external solutions as starting points, not threats
- **Focus on Outcomes**: Ask "What will achieve the best result?" rather than "Who created this?"
- **Adopt a "Best Idea Wins" Mentality**: Create a culture where the best solution wins, regardless of where it came from

## 5.2. **Long-term Practices**

- **Study Success Stories**: Examine cases where adopting external solutions led to great success
- **Create Innovation Time**: Allow teams to experiment with external tools and ideas in low-stakes environments
- **Build Cross-Functional Teams**: Encourage collaboration between different groups to reduce siloed thinking
- **Implement "Outside-In" Thinking**: Regularly bring in external perspectives and expertise

## 5.3. **Mindset Shifts**

- **Pride in Execution, Not Just Creation**: Take pride in implementing the best solutions, whatever their source
- **Standing on Shoulders of Giants**: Recognize that progress builds on others' work
- **Efficiency Over Ego**: Choose the most effective path, even if it means using others' solutions
- **Adoption is Innovation**: Successfully implementing external solutions can be as innovative as creating from scratch

## 5.4. üìã **Action Plan**

1. When facing a problem, first research existing solutions before deciding to build your own
2. Keep a "solution journal" documenting cases where external ideas worked better than internal ones
3. Regularly invite outside experts to review your processes and suggest improvements
4. Create incentives for teams that successfully implement external solutions
5. Practice saying "That's a great idea, let's adopt it" instead of "We could do that better"
