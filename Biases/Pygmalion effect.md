Imagine your teacher thinks you're going to be great at reading, so they give you extra help and praise. Because they believe in you, you actually become a great reader!

The Pygmalion effect is like magic - when people expect good things from you, you tend to do better, and when they expect bad things, you might do worse without even realizing it!
