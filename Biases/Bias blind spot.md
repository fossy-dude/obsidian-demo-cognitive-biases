# 1. ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5)

Imagine you have magic glasses that help you see when other people make mistakes in their thinking. You can easily spot when your friend thinks they're amazing at everything (but they're not), or when someone ignores important facts because they don't like them.

But here's the funny part: your magic glasses don't work when you look in the mirror! You can see everyone else's thinking mistakes, but you can't see your own. That's the bias blind spot - we're great at noticing biases in others but terrible at seeing them in ourselves.

It's like being a detective who can solve everyone else's mysteries but can't figure out their own messy room!

# 2. Recognizing the Bias

**Key signs you might have a bias blind spot:**

- **Quick to judge others**: You easily spot logical errors in other people's decisions
- **Defensive about your choices**: When someone questions your decisions, you get defensive rather than curious
- **"I'm different" thinking**: You believe you're less biased than average people
- **Overconfidence in objectivity**: You think you see things "as they really are" while others are clouded by bias
- **One-sided criticism**: You're good at finding flaws in arguments you disagree with but miss them in arguments you support

**The Research:** Studies show that about 85% of people believe they're less biased than the average person - which is mathematically impossible! This is called the "bias blind spot bias" - the meta-bias of not recognizing our own biases.

# 3. How It Shows Up üåü

## 3.1. **Workplace Examples**

- **Manager**: Quickly identifies team members' confirmation bias but fails to see their own favoritism toward certain employees
- **Team Member**: Points out colleagues' sunk cost fallacy in continuing failing projects, but defends their own time investment in a dead-end initiative
- **Hiring Manager**: Recognizes other interviewers' affinity bias but claims their own "gut feeling" about candidates is purely objective

## 3.2. **Daily Life Examples**

- **Social Media**: Easily spots political bias in opposing news sources but considers your preferred media outlet "fair and balanced"
- **Family Decisions**: Notices your spouse's emotional decision-making but believes your own choices are purely rational
- **Shopping**: Mocks friends for brand loyalty while insisting your preference for Apple/Android is based on "objective superiority"

## 3.3. **Financial Examples**

- **Investing**: Criticizes others for following investment fads while believing your own risky bets are "well-researched opportunities"
- **Budgeting**: Points out friends' lifestyle inflation but justifies your own spending upgrades as "necessary improvements"
- **Negotiations**: Recognizes when others are anchored by high prices but claims your own price targets are "fair market value"

# 4. Quick Test

**Self-Assessment Questions:**

1. When someone disagrees with you, is your first thought:
   - "What might I be missing?" ‚ùå
   - "Why are they so biased?" (Potential bias blind spot)

2. When reading news that contradicts your beliefs, do you:
   - Consider it might have valid points ‚ùå
   - Immediately look for the author's bias/agenda 3. When making important decisions, do you:
   - Seek out diverse perspectives ‚ùå
   - Trust your own judgment more than others' 4. When receiving feedback, is your reaction:
   - "Thank you, let me think about this" ‚ùå
   - "You don't understand the full context" 5. When analyzing past decisions, do you:
   - Acknowledge your biases and mistakes ‚ùå
   - Focus on external factors and other people's errors **If you answered "‚úÖ" to most questions, you might have a bias blind spot!**

# 5. How to Counteract Ô∏è

## 5.1. Immediate Strategies

- **ü§î The 24-Hour Rule**: Before criticizing others' biases, wait 24 hours and examine your own thinking on the same issue
- **üìù Bias Journal**: Keep a running list of biases you notice in others, then regularly check if you exhibit similar patterns
- **üë• Reverse Roles**: Before judging someone's decision, imagine you made the same choice - would your evaluation change?

## 5.2. Long-term Practices

- **Seek Disconfirming Evidence**: Actively look for information that challenges your beliefs, especially on important decisions
- **Quantify Your Confidence**: When making decisions, rate your confidence (1-10), then track accuracy over time
- **üëÇ Diverse Perspectives**: Regularly consult people with different backgrounds and viewpoints before finalizing decisions

## 5.3. Professional Applications

- **Decision Audits**: Create a personal decision review process where you explicitly check for common biases
- **Feedback Systems**: Build structured feedback loops where others can point out potential biases in your thinking
- **Pre-mortem Analysis**: Before important decisions, imagine they failed and identify potential biases that might have led to the failure

**Remember**: The goal isn't to eliminate all biases (impossible!) but to develop greater self-awareness and humility in your decision-making process.
