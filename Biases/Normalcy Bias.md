# 1. ELI5

Normalcy bias is when people underestimate the likelihood of disasters or major changes happening because they're used to things being normal and safe. It's like seeing dark storm clouds gathering but thinking "it probably won't rain" because you've seen sunny days for weeks. This bias makes us slow to prepare for emergencies or adapt to significant changes because we can't imagine life being different from how it is now.

# 2. Recognizing the Bias

- **Disaster denial**: Underestimating the probability or severity of potential crises
- **Continuation assumption**: Believing current conditions will persist indefinitely
- **Preparation procrastination**: Delaying emergency planning because "it won't happen here"
- **Normalization of warning signs**: Explaining away red flags as normal variations
- **Cognitive inflexibility**: Inability to mentally adapt to dramatically changed circumstances
- **Historical amnesia**: Forgetting that major disruptions have happened before and could happen again

# 3. How Bias Shows Up

**Workplace**: Employees ignore warning signs of company financial trouble, continuing with business as usual even as layoffs loom, because they can't imagine the stable company they've worked at for years could fail.

**Daily Life**: Homeowners in wildfire-prone areas don't create evacuation plans or clear brush around their houses, thinking "fires happen to other people" until they're faced with an immediate threat.

**Social Policy**: Communities resist implementing flood prevention measures despite rising water levels and climate change warnings, insisting "it's never flooded here before" while the risk increases each year.

**Economic Decisions**: Investors keep money in unstable markets because they believe "things always bounce back," ignoring indicators of fundamental economic shifts that could lead to prolonged downturns.

# 4. Quick Test or Checklist

**Do you experience normalcy bias?**

- Do you dismiss disaster warnings as "overreactions" or "media hype"?
- Have you avoided making emergency plans because you believe "it won't happen to me"?
- Do you assume that because something hasn't happened before, it won't happen in the future?
- Do you continue with normal routines despite clear warning signs of potential disruption?
- Do you feel uncomfortable discussing or preparing for worst-case scenarios?

# 5. How to Counteract

üìö **Scenario planning**: Regularly practice "what if" thinking for various emergency situations

ü§î **Probability assessment**: Learn to calculate and understand actual risks rather than relying on gut feelings

**Historical review**: Study past disasters and disruptions in your area or industry to understand they can and do happen

üí¨ **Expert consultation**: Listen to warnings from professionals and experts rather than dismissing them

 **Preparation practice**: Actually go through emergency drills and planning exercises

üìù **Risk inventory**: Create a comprehensive list of potential risks and their mitigation strategies

 **Early response training**: Practice recognizing and responding to early warning signs

**Regular reviews**: Periodically update emergency plans and reassess changing risk factors
