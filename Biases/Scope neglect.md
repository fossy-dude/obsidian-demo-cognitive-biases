# 1. ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5)

Imagine you have a big bowl of soup and a tiny cup of soup, both spilled on the floor. Most people would feel equally upset about both messes, even though the big bowl spill is much harder to clean up.

Scope neglect is when we don't properly notice how big or small a problem really is. We treat huge problems and tiny problems like they're the same, which makes it hard to figure out what's most important to fix first.

# 2. Recognizing the Bias

## 2.1. Key Signs to Watch For

**Equal Emotional Response**: You feel the same level of concern about problems of vastly different sizes or impacts.

**Proportion Blindness**: You can't explain why one problem deserves more resources than another, even when one is clearly more severe.

**Resource Misallocation**: You spend the same amount of time, money, or attention on minor issues as you do on major ones.

 **Scale Indifference**: When someone asks "how big is this problem?" you struggle to give a meaningful size or impact estimate.

‚öñÔ∏è **Priority Confusion**: You treat urgent, large-scale issues with the same importance as routine, small-scale matters.

# 3. How It Shows Up

## 3.1. Workplace Examples

- **Meeting Time Distribution**: Spending equal time discussing minor office supply issues as major strategic decisions that could affect company survival
- **Project Management**: Treating a small website bug fix with the same urgency and resources as a critical security vulnerability
- **Resource Allocation**: Giving the same budget amount to a team of 3 people as a team of 50 people, ignoring their different needs
- **Risk Assessment**: Equally worrying about minor compliance paperwork violations as major legal risks that could bankrupt the company

## 3.2. Daily Life Scenarios

- **Environmental Concern**: Feeling equally upset about one plastic bag as about massive ocean pollution, despite the vastly different environmental impacts
- **Health Reactions**: Reacting with the same level of panic to a minor paper cut as to a serious injury requiring medical attention
- **Home Maintenance**: Spending the same amount of time researching a $20 lamp purchase as a $200,000 home renovation
- **Emotional Investment**: Getting equally worked up over small social media comments as major relationship conflicts

## 3.3. Financial Decision-Making üí∞

- **Charitable Giving**: Donating the same amount to help one person as to help 1,000 people, ignoring the scope of impact
- **Investment Analysis**: Researching a $100 stock purchase with the same intensity as a $100,000 investment decision
- **Budget Prioritization**: Allocating equal funds to minor entertainment expenses as to critical financial needs like retirement savings
- **Risk Evaluation**: Worrying equally about losing $10 on a bet as losing $10,000 in a bad investment

# 4. Quick Test

## 4.1. Self-Assessment Questions

1. **The Magnitude Test**: When you hear about a problem affecting 100 people vs. 100,000 people, do you feel proportionally different levels of concern?

2. **The Resource Question**: If you had $1,000 to solve problems, would you split it equally among many small issues or focus it on the most impactful ones?

3. **The Priority Challenge**: Can you rank current problems in your life by their actual impact, or do they all feel equally important?

4. **The Scale Awareness**: When someone mentions "a big problem" vs. "a small problem," do you automatically adjust your response accordingly?

5. **The Impact Estimation**: If asked to estimate how much one problem costs vs. another, can you provide realistic proportional differences?

**Scoring**: If you answered "no" or "not really" to more than two questions, you may be experiencing scope neglect in your thinking.

# 5. How to Counteract

## 5.1. Ô∏è **Immediate Strategies**

### 5.1.1. **Scale Awareness Training**

- **Magnitude mapping**: Practice visualizing problems on a scale from 1-100 to develop better scope intuition
- **Proportion practice**: Regularly ask "how many times bigger/smaller is this compared to that?" to build proportional thinking
- **Impact quantification**: Force yourself to assign numbers to problems (people affected, dollars lost, time required)
- **Scope visualization**: Use graphs, charts, or physical representations to make size differences tangible

### 5.1.2. **Decision Framework Implementation**

- **Weighted prioritization**: Create systems where bigger problems automatically get more attention and resources
- **Impact multipliers**: Use mathematical multipliers to ensure decisions scale with problem size
- **Resource allocation formulas**: Develop clear formulas for distributing time, money, and attention based on scope
- **Scale checklists**: Include "how big is this really?" as a mandatory step in decision-making processes

## 5.2. **Systematic Approaches**

### 5.2.1. **Workplace Implementation**

- **Problem tier systems**: Categorize issues as Tier 1 (critical), Tier 2 (important), Tier 3 (minor) with different response protocols
- **Resource scaling rules**: Establish clear rules like "Tier 1 issues get 10x the resources of Tier 3 issues"
- **Impact assessment tools**: Use standardized tools to measure the true scope and impact of each problem
- **Priority matrices**: Implement frameworks that force consideration of both urgency and importance/scale

### 5.2.2. **Personal Life Applications**

- **Problem journaling**: Keep a log where you rate problems by actual impact vs. emotional response
- **Scope reality checks**: Regularly ask friends or family "Am I overreacting to the size of this problem?"
- **Proportional response planning**: Create response plans that scale with problem severity
- **Impact time allocation**: Deliberately spend more time on bigger problems than smaller ones

## 5.3. **Advanced Techniques**

### 5.3.1. **Mathematical Thinking Development**

- **Order of magnitude estimation**: Practice estimating whether something is 10x, 100x, or 1000x bigger/smaller
- **Logarithmic scale thinking**: Learn to think in terms of exponential rather than linear differences
- **Statistical literacy**: Develop better understanding of how sample sizes affect the significance of problems
- **Risk probability calibration**: Learn to properly assess how probability changes with scale

### 5.3.2. **Environmental And Social Impact**

- **System effects consideration**: Think about how problems affect larger systems, not just immediate impacts
- **Cascade effect analysis**: Consider how small problems might lead to much larger consequences
- **Network impact mapping**: Map how problems affect multiple stakeholders and systems
- **Long-term scope thinking**: Consider how the scope of problems might grow or shrink over time

## 5.4. **Professional Implementation**

### 5.4.1. **For Leaders and Managers**

- **Strategic prioritization frameworks**: Implement systems that automatically scale response with problem scope
- **Resource allocation governance**: Create formal processes that ensure larger problems get proportionally more resources
- **Impact measurement systems**: Develop metrics that accurately capture the true scope and significance of issues
- **Scope awareness training**: Train teams to recognize and properly respond to problems of different sizes

### 5.4.2. **For Teams and Organizations**

- **Problem classification systems**: Create clear categories with different response protocols
- **Scale-based escalation paths**: Ensure larger problems automatically get escalated to appropriate levels
- **Impact-weighted decision making**: Make formal scope assessment part of all significant decisions
- **Proportional resource distribution**: Build systems that automatically distribute resources based on problem scope

## 5.5. **Practical Exercises**

### 5.5.1. **Daily Scope Practice**

- **News analysis**: When reading news, consciously categorize stories by their actual societal impact
- **Personal problem ranking**: Weekly, list your problems and rank them by true importance vs. emotional weight
- **Resource allocation games**: Practice dividing limited resources among problems of different sizes
- **Scope vocabulary building**: Develop language to accurately describe differences in problem magnitude

**Remember**: Scope neglect is natural - our brains aren't wired to automatically process scale differences. The goal is to develop systems and habits that compensate for this limitation, helping you make more rational and effective decisions about where to focus your limited time, attention, and resources.

**Key Insight**: The most successful people and organizations aren't necessarily those with the most resources, but those who are best at allocating their resources proportionally to the scope of problems they face.
