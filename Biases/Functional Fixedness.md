# 1. ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5)

Imagine you have a toy car, and you only think it can drive on the floor. But what if you could use it as a doorstop, or to make cool patterns in paint, or to teach someone about wheels?

Functional fixedness is like getting stuck thinking things can only be used in one way - the way they're "supposed" to be used - instead of seeing all the creative possibilities!

# 2. Recognizing the Bias

Functional Fixedness is a Cognitive Bias that Limits Us to Using Objects only in Their Traditional, Intended Ways, Blocking Us from seeing Alternative Uses and Creative Solutions

**Warning Signs You're Experiencing Functional Fixedness:**

- **"That's not what it's for"** - Automatically rejecting alternative uses for objects
- **Tool tunnel vision** - Only considering the obvious, intended purpose of items
- **Creative roadblocks** - Getting stuck on problems because you can't see resources differently
- **"I need the right tool"** - Feeling stuck when you don't have the specific, traditional tool
- **Rigidity thinking** - Difficulty adapting when familiar objects or methods aren't available
- **Innovation barriers** - Missing solutions because you're focused on conventional approaches
- **Resource blindness** - Failing to see the potential in everyday objects around you

# 3. How Bias Shows Up

## 3.1. **Workplace Scenarios**

- **Problem-solving limitations** - Engineers overlooking simple solutions because they're focused on complex, traditional approaches
- **Resource waste** - Companies buying specialized equipment when everyday items could solve the problem
- **Innovation barriers** - Teams missing breakthrough ideas because they're stuck in conventional thinking patterns
- **Meeting inefficiencies** - People insisting on specific software or tools when simpler alternatives exist
- **Design constraints** - Designers limiting themselves to standard materials and methods instead of experimenting

## 3.2. **Daily Life Examples**

- **Home repairs** - Going to buy a specific tool when a household item could work just as well
- **Kitchen creativity** - Only using appliances for their "intended" purpose instead of finding multiple uses
- **Emergency solutions** - Feeling helpless in situations where creative use of available items could solve the problem
- **Craft projects** - Limiting yourself to traditional art supplies instead of using everyday objects
- **Storage solutions** - Buying specialized organizers when ordinary items could serve the same purpose

## 3.3. **Financial Decision Impact**

- **Unnecessary purchases** - Buying single-purpose gadgets when multi-purpose items would work better
- **Business expenses** - Companies overspending on specialized equipment instead of finding creative alternatives
- **Investment myopia** - Missing opportunities because you can only see traditional investment vehicles
- **Budget constraints** - Feeling limited by lack of resources instead of finding creative workarounds
- **Marketing blind spots** - Only using traditional advertising methods instead of innovative, low-cost alternatives

## 3.4. **Educational And Learning Impact**

- **Teaching limitations** - Educators only using standard teaching methods instead of creative approaches
- **Student problem-solving** - Students getting stuck on problems because they can't think beyond traditional methods
- **Learning barriers** - Difficulty grasping concepts when presented in unconventional ways
- **Assessment rigidity** - Only evaluating learning through traditional tests and assignments
- **Resource limitations** - Schools and students feeling constrained by lack of "proper" materials

# 4. Quick Test or Checklist

**Self-Assessment Questions:**

1. **The Alternative Uses Test**: Pick a common object (paperclip, rubber band, brick). Can you list at least 10 different uses for it?
2. **The Problem-Solving Flexibility Check**: When faced with a problem, do you automatically reach for traditional solutions, or do you consider unconventional approaches?
3. **The Resource Assessment**: In a challenging situation, do you focus on what you don't have, or do you look for creative ways to use what you do have?
4. **The Innovation Barrier**: Do you often find yourself saying "I need X" to solve a problem, when something else might work just as well?

**The Classic Candle Problem Test:**

Imagine you're given:

- A candle
- A box of thumbtacks
- A book of matches

Your task: Attach the candle to the wall so it can burn without dripping wax on the floor.

**Solution**: Empty the thumbtack box, tack it to the wall, and use it as a platform for the candle. Many people miss this because they see the box only as a container, not as a potential platform.

**Decision Review Checklist:**
- [ ] Am I only considering the traditional use of this object/method?
- [ ] What other purposes could this serve beyond its intended function?
- [ ] Do I really need specialized equipment, or can I work creatively with what I have?
- [ ] Am I limiting myself by thinking "this is how it's always been done"?

# 5. How to Counteract ️

## 5.1. **Immediate Strategies**

- **Question assumptions** - Ask "what else could this do?" for everyday objects
- **Break from tradition** - Challenge yourself to use things in unconventional ways
- **Multiple perspectives** - Look at objects from different angles and contexts
- **Resource scanning** - Train yourself to see potential in everything around you

## 5.2. **Creative Thinking Exercises**

- **Alternative uses practice** - Regularly pick random objects and list 20+ different uses
- **Constraint challenges** - Solve problems with limited resources to force creative thinking
- **Cross-domain thinking** - Apply solutions from one field to problems in another
- **Analogical reasoning** - Ask "how would this problem be solved in nature/in another culture?"

## 5.3. **Systematic Approaches**

- **Design thinking methodology** - Use human-centered design approaches that encourage creative problem-solving
- **SCAMPER technique** - Apply Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to other uses, Eliminate, Reverse
- **TRIZ methodology** - Use systematic innovation tools to break functional fixedness
- **Morphological analysis** - Break problems into parameters and explore all combinations

## 5.4. **Professional Applications**

- **Innovation workshops** - Conduct regular sessions focused on creative problem-solving
- **Cross-functional teams** - Bring together people from different backgrounds to challenge conventional thinking
- **Prototyping culture** - Encourage rapid prototyping with available materials
- **Failure celebration** - Create environments where trying unconventional approaches is rewarded

## 5.5. **Personal Life Implementation**

- **DIY mindset** - Develop a "do-it-yourself" attitude that encourages creative problem-solving
- **Object repurposing** - Regularly find new uses for household items
- **Skill diversification** - Learn skills from different fields to expand your problem-solving toolkit
- **Curiosity cultivation** - Maintain childlike curiosity about how things work and what they could become

## 5.6. **Long-term Development**

- **Creative hobbies** - Engage in activities that require flexible thinking and resourcefulness
- **Pattern recognition training** - Learn to see patterns and connections across different domains
- **Constraint-based living** - Occasionally impose artificial constraints to force creative solutions
- **Mindful observation** - Practice really seeing the objects and resources around you

> **Remember**: The most innovative solutions often come from seeing the extraordinary in the ordinary. Every object around you has countless potential uses beyond its intended purpose.

**Key Insight**: Functional fixedness isn't just about objects - it's about mental flexibility. By learning to break free from conventional thinking, you unlock not just creative solutions to problems, but a more innovative and resourceful approach to life itself.
