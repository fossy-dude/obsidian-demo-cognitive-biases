# 1. ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5)

Imagine you see a plant that isn't growing well, and you immediately think "That plant must be lazy and not trying hard enough!" instead of noticing it's not getting enough sunlight or water. Puritanical bias is when we blame people's problems on their character or willpower, instead of looking at the bigger reasons like their circumstances, environment, or the systems they're in.

It's like getting mad at someone for being wet in the rain, instead of noticing they don't have an umbrella and it's pouring outside!

# 2. Recognizing the Bias

Puritanical Bias Leads Us to Attribute Negative Outcomes Primarily to Individual Moral Failings or lack of Self-control, while Ignoring Broader Societal and Environmental Factors

- **Character judgments** - Focusing on personal traits rather than circumstances

- **"I overcame it, so can they"** - Assuming your experience applies to everyone

# 4. Quick Test or Checklist

**Self-Assessment Questions:**
1. When you see someone struggling, do you first think about their character or their circumstances?
2. Have you ever said "If I can do it, anyone can" without considering your advantages?
3. Do you tend to attribute success to virtue and failure to vice?
4. When analyzing problems, do you focus more on individuals than on systems?

**The Puritanical Bias Test:**
- When you hear about someone's failure, what's your first thought? "They didn't try hard enough" or "What obstacles did they face?"
- Consider a time you succeeded: How much was your effort versus how much was support, timing, and luck?
- Ask yourself: "Would I make the same choices if I had their exact circumstances?"

**Perspective Shift Checklist:**
- [ ] Before judging, ask: "What systemic factors might be influencing this situation?"
- [ ] Consider: "What advantages or privileges do I have that others might not?"
- [ ] Ask: "What would this look like if roles were reversed?"
- [ ] Check: "Am I focusing on individual character when systems might be the real issue?"
