# 1. ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5)

Imagine you know a secret that nobody else knows. When you try to explain something using that secret, you forget that other people don't know it! The curse of knowledge is when you're so good at something or know so much about it that you can't remember what it was like not to know it.

It's like being a bike expert who tells someone "just balance and pedal!" without realizing they need to learn how to balance first.

# 2. Recognizing the Bias

**Warning Signs in Yourself:**
- Using jargon or technical terms without explanation
- Skipping steps because "they're obvious"
- Getting frustrated when others don't understand quickly
- Assuming everyone has the same background knowledge as you
- Using acronyms without defining them first

**Warning Signs in Others:**
- Confused expressions or frequent "what do you mean?" questions
- People nodding along but not actually following
- Requests to "start from the beginning" or "speak in simple terms"
- Multiple clarifying questions about basics

# 3. How It Shows Up

**Workplace Examples:**
- **IT Support**: "Just reboot your router!" without explaining how to access it
- **Manager Training**: Assuming new hires understand company jargon and processes
- **Technical Presentations**: Using specialized terms with non-technical stakeholders
- **Code Reviews**: "This should be self-explanatory" comments that aren't

**Daily Life Examples:**
- **Cooking**: "Just sautÃ© until done!" without explaining what "sautÃ©" means
- **Technology**: "It's simple, just connect to the Wi-Fi!" assuming everyone knows how
- **Sports**: "Just use proper form!" without demonstrating what proper form looks like
- **Driving Directions**: "Take the back way!" assuming knowledge of local shortcuts

**Financial Examples:**
- **Investment Advice**: "Diversify your portfolio!" without explaining what diversification means
- **Budgeting**: "Just follow the 50/30/20 rule!" assuming people know what that is
- **Tax Preparation**: Using terms like "deductions" and "credits" without explanation
- **Real Estate**: "It's a fixer-upper!" assuming people understand renovation scope

**Educational Examples:**
- **Teachers**: Moving too quickly through foundational concepts
- **Mentors**: Skipping "basic" steps that aren't basic to beginners
- **Tutorials**: Assuming prerequisite knowledge without stating it
- **Online Courses**: Using advanced terminology in introductory content

# 4. Quick Test

ðŸ“‹ **Self-Check Questions:**

1. **The "5-Year-Old Test"**: Could you explain this concept to a 5-year-old? If not, you might be assuming too much knowledge.
2. **The Jargon Check**: Count how many technical terms or acronyms you used without explanation. More than 2? You might have the curse.
3. **The Step Count**: Did you skip any steps because they "seem obvious"? If yes, that's a red flag.

 **Quick Scenarios to Consider:**
- When you say "everyone knows this..." do they really?
- Are you using terms that took you years to learn?
- Do you find yourself thinking "this is so simple" when others struggle?

# 5. How to Counteract

**Communication Strategies:**
- **Start from Zero**: Always begin with basic assumptions, even if they seem "too basic"
- **The Feynman Technique**: Try to explain concepts in the simplest possible terms
- **Define Your Terms**: Create a glossary of jargon and explain each term before using it
- **Use Analogies**: Connect new concepts to familiar experiences

**Prevention Tools:**
- **The "Beginner's Mind"**: Approach every explanation as if you're learning it for the first time
- **Check for Understanding**: Pause frequently and ask "Does this make sense?" or "Should I explain that differently?"
- **Layer Your Information**: Start simple, then add complexity gradually
- **Use Visual Aids**: Diagrams, examples, and demonstrations help bridge knowledge gaps

**Workplace Applications:**
- **Create Playbooks**: Document step-by-step processes for common tasks
- **Peer Review**: Have someone less knowledgeable review your explanations
- **Feedback Loops**: Regularly ask for clarification on communication effectiveness
- **Knowledge Mapping**: Identify and document prerequisite knowledge for complex topics

**Daily Life Practice:**
- **Teach Someone**: The best way to overcome the curse is to teach others regularly
- **Listen Actively**: Pay attention to confusion signals and adjust accordingly
- **Ask Questions**: "What do you already know about this?" before explaining
- **Be Patient**: Remember that everyone's learning journey is different

**Remember**: The curse of knowledge isn't about being smartâ€”it's about forgetting what it's like not to know. The wisest experts are those who can make complex ideas simple and accessible to everyone.
