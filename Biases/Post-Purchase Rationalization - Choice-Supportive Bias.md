Post-purchase rationalization is like when you buy a toy that looked awesome in the store, but then you notice it's not that great. Instead of admitting you made a mistake, you start telling everyone how amazing it is and finding all sorts of good things about it! üéÅü§î Your brain tricks you into loving your choice just to avoid feeling bad about it.
