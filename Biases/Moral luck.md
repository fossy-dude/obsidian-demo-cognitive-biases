# 1. ELI5

Moral luck is like when two kids both run across the street without looking, but only one gets hit by a car. We think the kid who got hit was "bad" or "stupid" because of what happened, even though both kids did the exact same thing. It's when we judge people's decisions based on how things turned out rather than on what they actually chose to do.

# 2. Recognizing the Bias

**Warning Signs in Your Thinking:**
- You judge someone's decision more harshly because it had bad results
- You praise someone's wisdom mainly because things worked out well
- You find yourself saying "They should have known better" only when something goes wrong
- You're more forgiving of risky behavior that ends well than the same behavior that ends poorly
- You blame people for outcomes they couldn't have reasonably predicted

**Physical & Behavioral Indicators:**
- Second-guessing decisions only after seeing negative outcomes
- Giving credit for good outcomes rather than good processes
- Harsher criticism of failed initiatives than successful ones with similar approaches
- Changing your evaluation of someone's character based on events outside their control

# 3. How Bias Shows Up

## 3.1. **Workplace Scenarios**

- A manager who takes a risky business decision is celebrated when it succeeds but fired when it fails, even though the decision-making process was identical
- An employee who reports safety concerns is ignored until an accident happens, then blamed for not speaking up "loudly enough"
- Two teams make the same strategic mistake, but only the one that loses market share gets criticized
- A project leader is praised as "brilliant" when external factors make their project successful, but called "incompetent" when the same factors work against them

## 3.2. **Daily Life Examples**

- You call someone "reckless" for driving in the rain, but only after they get into an accident
- You judge a parent's decision to let their child play outside differently based on whether the child gets hurt
- You think someone was "wise" to invest in a stock only after it goes up in value
- You criticize someone's life choices only when you see them struggling, even if you'd make the same choices

## 3.3. **Financial Decision Making**

- An investor who makes risky bets is called a "genius" when they win but "foolish" when they lose
- You blame yourself for a bad investment decision only when it loses money, not when it gains
- People who gamble and win are seen as "skilled," while those who lose are "irresponsible"
- You judge someone's financial wisdom based on their investment outcomes rather than their strategy

## 3.4. **Health & Safety Impact**

- Parents are judged as "negligent" only if their child gets injured doing a common activity
- Someone who drinks and drives is seen as "irresponsible" only if they get caught or cause an accident
- A person is called "health-conscious" only if their diet choices lead to good health outcomes
- You judge someone's risk-taking behavior based on whether they got hurt, not on the actual risk level

# 4. Quick Test or Checklist

**Check yourself with these questions:**

ü§î **When evaluating decisions, do you:**

- Judge the decision differently after seeing the outcome?
- Focus more on results than on the reasoning process?
- Find yourself saying "I told you so" only when things go wrong?

**Outcome Independence Test:**
- Would you make the same decision if you couldn't know the outcome?
- Can you separate the quality of the decision from the quality of the result?
- Do you evaluate processes and outcomes separately?

‚öñÔ∏è **Perspective Check:**

- Would you judge someone differently if they made the same choice but got lucky/unlucky?
- Are you consistent in evaluating identical decisions with different outcomes?
- Do you give more weight to circumstances than to the actual choices made?

# 5. How to Counteract

## 5.1. **Immediate Strategies**

- **Separate Process from Outcome**: Evaluate decisions based on the information available at the time, not the results
- **Focus on Intentions**: Consider what the person was trying to achieve and their reasoning process
- **Ask "What Did They Know?"**: Evaluate decisions based on the information available when the choice was made
- **Practice Outcome Independence**: Judge the decision-making process separately from the results

## 5.2. **Long-term Practices**

- **Study Decision Quality**: Learn about decision science and good decision-making processes
- **Embrace Probabilistic Thinking**: Understand that good decisions can have bad outcomes and vice versa
- **Keep Decision Journals**: Record your reasoning for important decisions, then review them later without outcome bias
- **Study Near Misses**: Examine situations where disaster was narrowly avoided to understand risk better

## 5.3. **Mindset Shifts**

- **Outcomes Don't Equal Wisdom**: Success doesn't prove good decision-making, and failure doesn't prove bad decision-making
- **Focus on Controllables**: Judge people (and yourself) based on what was within their control
- **Embrace Uncertainty**: Recognize that luck plays a role in most outcomes
- **Process Over Results**: Value good decision-making processes more heavily than good outcomes

## 5.4. üìã **Action Plan**

1. When reviewing decisions, ask "What information did they have?" before asking "What happened?"
2. Practice evaluating hypothetical scenarios with different outcomes
3. Study cases where identical decisions led to different results
4. Notice when your judgment changes after seeing outcomes
5. Develop a framework for evaluating decision quality that's separate from results
