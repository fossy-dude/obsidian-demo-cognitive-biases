# 1. ELI5

Social cryptomnesia is when people know that something in society has changed, but they forget how or why that change happened. It's like remembering that a new rule exists at school, but having no idea who made the rule or when it was created. The change becomes normal and people act as if it was always that way.

# 2. Recognizing the Bias

- **Historical amnesia**: You know a social norm exists but can't explain its origin
- **Presentism**: Assuming current values and practices were always accepted
- **Attribution errors**: Crediting current leaders for changes that happened long ago
- **Normalization**: Treating recent social changes as if they're timeless traditions
- **Collective forgetting**: Groups accept changes without questioning their origins

# 3. How Bias Shows Up

**Workplace**: A company implements flexible work hours during a crisis, and after the crisis passes, employees insist "we've always had flexible hours" when management tries to revert to traditional schedules.

**Daily Life**: People forget that recycling was once controversial and now act as if environmental consciousness has always been the norm, criticizing those who don't recycle without understanding the movement's history.

**Social Policy**: Voters forget that social security or healthcare programs were once debated innovations and now treat them as immutable rights, making reform discussions emotionally charged.

**Economic Changes**: People forget that credit cards were once restricted to wealthy consumers and now treat widespread consumer debt as natural economic behavior.

# 4. Quick Test or Checklist

**Do you experience social cryptomnesia?**

- Can you explain the historical origin of social norms you strongly defend?
- Do you assume current practices were always accepted throughout history?
- When discussing policy changes, do you consider how recent these changes really are?
- Do you find yourself saying "that's just how things are" without knowing why?
- Can you identify who pioneered changes you now take for granted?

# 5. How to Counteract

üìö **Study history**: Regularly read about the origins of current social norms and practices

ü§î **Question assumptions**: Ask "when did this start?" and "who promoted this change?"

**Track changes**: Keep notes on when you first encounter new social trends and norms

üí¨ **Consult elders**: Talk to people from different generations about how things used to be

 **Historical context**: Before defending current practices, research their historical development and acceptance

üìù **Document processes**: In organizations, keep records of why changes were made to prevent organizational cryptomnesia
