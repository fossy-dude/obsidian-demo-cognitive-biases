# 1. ELI5

Imagine you have a glass of juice that's half full. If I say "it's half full," you might feel happy. If I say "it's half empty," you might feel sad. Even though it's the same amount of juice, the way I describe it changes how you feel! That's the framing effect - when the same information makes us think differently just because of how it's presented.

# 2. Recognizing the Bias

**Warning Signs to Watch For:**

Ô∏è **Emotional Language**: Words that trigger strong feelings (amazing vs. terrible)

Ô∏è **Percent vs. Absolute Numbers**: "90% success" vs. "10% failure" for the same thing

Ô∏è **Gain vs. Loss Framing**: "Save $10" vs. "Avoid losing $10"

Ô∏è **Comparative Language**: "Better than" or "Worse than" without context

Ô∏è **Selective Statistics**: Highlighting one number while hiding others

Ô∏è **Visual Presentation**: Charts and graphs designed to emphasize certain aspects

**Common Red Flags:**
- Marketing that focuses on benefits while downplaying costs
- Political messages emphasizing different aspects of the same policy
- Financial products showing high returns without mentioning risks

# 3. How Bias Shows Up

## 3.1. **Workplace Scenarios**

**Performance Reviews**:
- "You're in the top 20% of performers" (positive frame)
- "80% of employees outperform you" (negative frame)

**Project Updates**:
- "We're 80% complete" (optimistic)
- "We have 20% remaining" (pessimistic)

**Salary Negotiations**:
- "You'll get a 5% raise" (gain frame)
- "You'll only lose 2% to inflation" (loss frame)

## 3.2. **Daily Life Examples**

**Health Choices**:
- "This yogurt is 95% fat-free" sounds healthier than "This yogurt contains 5% fat"

**Weather Reports**:
- "There's a 40% chance of rain" vs. "There's a 60% chance of sunshine"

**Restaurant Menus**:
- "Grilled chicken" vs. "Chicken, grilled" - the first sounds more appealing

## 3.3. **Financial Decisions**

**Investment Options**:
- "This fund has an 85% success rate" vs. "This fund loses money 15% of the time"

**Insurance Products**:
- "Save $200 on premiums" vs. "Risk losing $200 in potential savings"

**Shopping Deals**:
- "Buy 2, get 1 free" vs. "Get 33% off when buying 3 items"

## 3.4. **Marketing & Advertising**

**Pricing Strategies**:
- "Only $2.99" vs. "$3.00" - the first feels significantly cheaper
- "Limited time offer" creates urgency vs. "Available while supplies last"

**Product Descriptions**:
- "Anti-aging cream" vs. "Moisturizer for mature skin"
- "Diet soda" vs. "Sugar-free soda"

# 4. Quick Test or Checklist

**Ask yourself these questions:**

ü§î **Reframe Test**: Can I express the opposite perspective just as truthfully?

- If yes, you might be experiencing framing bias

ü§î **Neutral Language Test**: How would I describe this if I had no emotional stake?

- If your description changes significantly, framing is influencing you

ü§î **Complete Picture Test**: What information might be missing from this presentation?

- Look for what's NOT being said

ü§î **Numbers Check**: Are percentages being used to hide absolute numbers?

- "90% success" on 10 people vs. 10,000 people makes a big difference

**Self-Check Scenarios:**
- Do I feel differently about the same information when it's worded differently?
- Am I making decisions based on emotions rather than facts?
- Would I choose differently if the information was presented neutrally?

# 5. How to Counteract

## 5.1. üõ†Ô∏è **Immediate Strategies**

**1. Reframe the Information**
- Actively rephrase the information in the opposite way
- Example: If told "90% success rate," immediately think "10% failure rate"

**2. Seek Neutral Language**
- Strip away emotional wording and focus on raw facts
- Ask: "What are the actual numbers, regardless of how they're presented?"

**3. Consider the Source**
- Who benefits from this particular framing?
- What might their motivation be?

## 5.2. **Long-term Habits**

**4. Develop Multiple Perspectives**
- Practice viewing the same information from different angles
- Ask others how they would frame the same information

**5. Focus on Absolute Numbers**
- Convert percentages to actual numbers when possible
- Example: "20% discount on $100" = "$20 saved"

**6. Create Decision Frameworks**
- Use consistent criteria for evaluating options
- Remove emotional language from your decision-making process

**7. Delay Important Decisions**
- Take time to let emotional framing fade
- Return to the decision later with fresh eyes

## 5.3. üí° **Professional Applications**

**For Business Leaders:**
- Present information using multiple frames
- Train teams to recognize framing in communications
- Use data visualization that shows complete pictures

**For Consumers:**
- Research beyond marketing language
- Compare absolute values, not just percentages
- Look for independent, unbiased reviews
