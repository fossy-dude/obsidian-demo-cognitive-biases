# 1. ELI5

Imagine you're really hungry and someone asks you to plan what you'll want to eat next week. You might pick a huge meal because you're so hungry right now! But when next week comes and you're not hungry anymore, you might not want that big meal at all. The hot-cold empathy gap is when how we feel RIGHT NOW (hot state) makes it hard to understand or predict how we'll feel LATER (cold state), or how other people feel when they're in different situations.

# 2. Recognizing the Bias

**Warning Signs to Watch For:**

- You make decisions when emotional that you later regret when calm
- You have trouble understanding why people make choices that seem "irrational" to you
- You underestimate how much your current mood is influencing your decisions
- You find yourself saying "I'll never feel like doing that" when you're in a different emotional state
- You notice your preferences change dramatically based on your current physical or emotional state
- You struggle to relate to others' experiences when you're not in the same situation
- You make commitments in one state that you can't keep in another
- You discount the importance of factors that aren't relevant to your current state

# 3. How Bias Shows Up

## 3.1. **Workplace Scenarios**

- **Hiring decisions**: Interviewers in good moods tend to rate candidates more favorably and overlook potential issues
- **Salary negotiations**: People in desperate financial situations accept worse terms than they would when financially stable
- **Project planning**: Teams excited about a new project underestimate future obstacles and timeline challenges
- **Performance reviews**: Managers in stressed states are more critical and less empathetic in feedback
- **Crisis management**: Leaders in "hot" states make impulsive decisions they later question when calm
- **Team conflicts**: Heated arguments lead to irreversible decisions that participants regret when cooled down

## 3.2. **Daily Life Examples**

- **Grocery shopping**: Shopping while hungry leads to buying more food than needed, often unhealthy options
- **Exercise commitments**: People often overcommit to exercise routines when feeling motivated but struggle to follow through
- **Angry decisions**: Sending angry texts or emails that are later regretted when emotions cool
- **Social plans**: Making enthusiastic social plans when feeling extroverted but wanting to cancel when feeling introverted
- **Health choices**: Quitting bad habits when motivated but relapsing when motivation fades
- **Relationship conflicts**: Breaking up during fights but regretting it when emotions settle

## 3.3. **Financial Decision Making**

- **Investment panic**: Selling investments during market crashes (fear) that would have recovered
- **Shopping sprees**: Making impulsive purchases when excited or depressed
- **Insurance decisions**: Buying unnecessary insurance when fearful, skipping necessary coverage when confident
- **Retirement planning**: Underestimating future needs when focused on present enjoyment
- **Debt accumulation**: Taking on debt when excited about purchases, struggling with repayment later
- **Risk assessment**: Being overly cautious when scared, overly risky when confident

# 4. Quick Test or Checklist

**Self-Assessment: Are You Experiencing Hot-Cold Empathy Gap?**

‚ùì **Do you find yourself...**

- [ ] Making decisions when emotional that you later question when calm?
- [ ] Having trouble understanding why people make choices that seem different from what you'd choose?
- [ ] Underestimating how much your current mood affects your judgment?
- [ ] Making commitments in one emotional state that you struggle to keep in another?
- [ ] Feeling surprised by your own preferences when your situation changes?

‚ùì **State Check Questions:**

1. "What emotional or physical state am I in right now?"
2. "How might I feel about this decision if I were tired/hungry/stressed/excited?"
3. "If I weren't feeling this way right now, what would I want my future self to do?"

**The 3-State Test**: When making an important decision, ask:
- üî• **Hot State**: "If I were angry/excited/desperate, what would I choose?"
- ‚ùÑÔ∏è **Cold State**: "If I were calm/rational/objective, what would I choose?"
- üå°Ô∏è **Future State**: "How will I feel about this decision tomorrow/next week/next year?"

**Score yourself:** 0-1 checkmarks = Low bias, 2-3 checkmarks = Moderate bias, 4-5 checkmarks = High bias

# 5. How to Counteract

**Practical Strategies to Reduce Hot-Cold Empathy Gap:**

## 5.1. ü§î **Implement Decision Delays**

- **The 24-hour rule**: For significant decisions, wait 24 hours before finalizing
- **Cooling-off periods**: Step away from emotional situations before making choices
- **Multiple review points**: Review important decisions at different times and emotional states
- **Sleep on it**: Major decisions benefit from overnight consideration and emotional reset

## 5.2. üìù **Create Decision Frameworks**

- **Pre-commitment strategies**: Make rules for yourself in advance (e.g., "no shopping when hungry")
- **Decision journals**: Record your emotional state when making important choices
- **Checklist systems**: Use standardized criteria to reduce emotional influence
- **Future self-letters**: Write letters to your future self about current decisions and reasoning

## 5.3. üë• **Seek External Perspectives**

- **Consult trusted advisors**: Get input from people in different emotional states
