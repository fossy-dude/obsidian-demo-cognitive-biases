# 1. ELI5

Essentialism is like thinking every type of thing has a special "essence" or core nature that makes it what it is. It's like believing all cats have "cat-ness" inside them, or that some people are just "naturally good at math" because of something special inside them. We sometimes think things can't change because we believe they have a fixed identity or purpose.

# 2. Recognizing the Bias Ô∏è

**Warning Signs:**
- Using phrases like "they're just born that way" or "it's in their nature"
- Believing certain groups inherently share specific traits or abilities
- Assuming people's core characteristics are fixed and unchangeable
- Categorizing things as having "essential" properties that define them completely
- Thinking that because something looks like a category member, it must have all the category's traits
- Believing there's only one "true" or "correct" way for things to be
- Resisting evidence that challenges your view of what's "natural" or "normal" for a category

# 3. How It Shows Up üåü

**Workplace Examples:**
- Assuming "natural leaders" are born, not developed through experience and training
- Believing some people are inherently "creative types" while others are "analytical types"
- Thinking certain roles are "better suited" for specific genders or age groups
- Expecting employees from particular backgrounds to have fixed cultural traits

**Daily Life Examples:**
- Thinking some children are "naturally" athletic while others are "bookish"
- Believing certain cultures have inherent traits that can't change
- Assuming people from specific regions share essential characteristics
- Thinking "boys will be boys" or "girls are just more emotional" as biological facts

**Financial Examples:**
- Believing "money people" have an inherent talent for finance that can't be learned
- Thinking certain ethnic groups are "naturally better" at business or mathematics
- Assuming someone's background determines their financial capability
- Viewing investment success as requiring innate "business instincts" rather than knowledge and practice

**Personal Relationships:**
- Believing in "soulmates" who have essential compatibility traits
- Thinking people have fixed personality types that can't evolve
- Assuming romantic preferences are biologically determined rather than shaped by experience

# 4. Quick Test

**Ask yourself these 3 questions:**

1. **Fixed vs. Growth Thinking**: When someone excels at something, do you think "they were born with it" or "they worked hard to develop this skill"?

2. **Generalization Check**: When you meet someone from a group you know, do you expect them to have certain traits "because that's how people from [group] are"?

3. **Change Resistance**: When evidence challenges your view of what's "natural" for a category, do you find yourself rejecting the evidence rather than updating your beliefs?

**If you answered "yes" to any of these**, you might be experiencing essentialist thinking. Remember that most human characteristics and abilities exist on spectrums and can be developed through experience, effort, and environmental factors.

# 5. How to Counteract Ô∏è

**Immediate Actions:**
- **Practice Growth Mindset**: Replace "they're just born that way" with "they developed that through practice"
- **Seek Individual Differences**: Look for variations within groups rather than focusing on similarities
- **Question Categories**: Ask "what evidence do I have that this trait is essential vs. learned?"

**Workplace Strategies:**
- **Focus on Potential**: Evaluate people based on what they can learn, not what they currently know
- **Diverse Hiring**: Look beyond traditional "essential" qualifications to varied experiences
- **Skill Development**: Invest in training programs that challenge fixed-ability assumptions

**Daily Life Approaches:**
- **Embrace Complexity**: Recognize that most traits exist on spectrums, not as fixed categories
- **Learn Individual Stories**: Focus on personal narratives rather than group stereotypes
- **Celebrate Growth**: Acknowledge how people change and develop over time

**Long-term Mindset Shift:**
- **See People as Dynamic**: View individuals as evolving, not static entities
- **Value Process Over Labels**: Focus on how things happen rather than what something "is"
- **Embrace Uncertainty**: Accept that categories are human constructs, not natural laws
