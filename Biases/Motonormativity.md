# 1. ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5) 🚗

Imagine if everyone thought it was totally normal for people to run around with scissors, but got really upset when someone rode a bike too fast. Motonormativity is like that - we think cars are just a normal part of life, even though they cause a lot of problems, but we get really worried about much smaller dangers from other ways of getting around.

It's when we think "cars are just how things are" and don't notice all the trouble they cause, while freaking out about tiny risks from walking, biking, or taking the bus.

# 2. Recognizing the Bias

Motonormativity is the Unconscious Assumption that Car Use is Normal, Necessary, and Acceptable, while other Transportation Modes Are Seen as Unusual, Optional, or Problematic

**Warning Signs of Motonormativity:**
- **"Drivers pay for roads"** - Assuming roads exist only for cars and that gas taxes cover all costs (they don't)
- **"Bikers don't belong here"** - Believing roads are primarily for motor vehicles
- **"Nobody would walk that far"** - Assuming distances are only practical by car
- **"Public transit is for poor people"** - Stereotyping alternative transportation users
- **"Traffic is just inevitable"** - Accepting congestion as unavoidable rather than a design choice
- **"Parking should be free"** - Expecting car storage to be subsidized in all locations

# 3. How Bias Shows Up

## 3.1. **Workplace & Business Impact**

- **Office location decisions** - Assuming employees can all drive to work, limiting potential hires
- **Parking requirements** - Mandating excessive parking spaces that drive up costs
- **Delivery expectations** - Prioritizing fast vehicle delivery over environmental impacts
- **Business location** - Choosing car-dependent locations that exclude non-drivers
- **Commute benefits** - Offering parking subsidies but not transit passes or bike facilities

## 3.2. **Daily Life Examples**

- **School drop-offs** - Creating traffic jams around schools while worrying about "stranger danger" for walkers
- **Short car trips** - Driving 2 blocks for milk while complaining about lack of exercise
- **Social invitations** - "Everyone can drive here" without considering non-driving guests
- **Housing choices** - Rejecting walkable neighborhoods due to perceived parking issues
- **Package delivery** - Expecting instant car delivery while complaining about traffic

## 3.3. **Financial Decision Impact**

- **Hidden subsidies** - Not noticing that gas taxes cover only about 50% of road costs
- **Healthcare costs** - Ignoring the billions in health impacts from air pollution and accidents
- **Property values** - Overpaying for car-dependent housing without considering long-term costs
- **Infrastructure spending** - Supporting road expansions while transit systems suffer
- **Insurance premiums** - Not connecting high car insurance rates to systemic risks

## 3.4. **Policy & Planning Effects**

- **"Road diets" opposition** - Fighting bike lanes and pedestrian improvements
- **Parking minimums** - Requiring excessive parking that makes areas less walkable
- **Speed limit discussions** - Resisting lower speed limits despite safety benefits
- **Zoning laws** - Separating homes from services, forcing car dependency
- **Transportation budgets** - Allocating 80%+ of funds to car infrastructure

# 4. Quick Test or Checklist

**Self-Assessment Questions:**
1. When you hear about a traffic fatality, do you think "accidents happen" but when you hear about a bike or pedestrian death, do you think "they should have been more careful"?
2. Do you complain about traffic but resist solutions that might inconvenience drivers?
3. Have you ever said "I'd walk/bike more, but..." followed by an excuse you wouldn't accept for other activities?
4. Do you assume everyone has access to a car or can drive?

**The Motonormativity Test:**
- How many trips under 1 mile did you take by car last week?
- When you see a bike lane, do you think "taking space from cars" or "making space for people"?
- Do you know the actual cost of your car including gas, insurance, maintenance, and depreciation?
- Have you ever tried using alternative transportation for a trip you normally drive?

**Decision Review Checklist:**
- [ ] When planning an event, do you consider non-driving guests?
- [ ] Do you support transit funding even if you don't use it?
- [ ] Can you walk, bike, or take transit to your regular destinations?
- [ ] Do you notice the hidden costs of car dependency in your community?

# 5. How to Counteract ️

## 5.1. **Immediate Actions**

- **Try alternative transport** - Experiment with walking, biking, or transit for one trip per week
- **Question assumptions** - When you think "I have to drive," ask "Is that really true?"
- **Notice hidden costs** - Calculate your true car costs including gas, insurance, maintenance, and time
- **Observe without judgment** - Watch how space is allocated - notice cars vs. people space

## 5.2. **Mindset Shifts**

- **Reframe normal** - Recognize that car dependency is a recent historical anomaly, not natural
- **Consider externalities** - Think about the full social, environmental, and health impacts of transportation choices
- **Embrace multiplicity** - Support multiple transportation options rather than prioritizing one
- **Long-term thinking** - Consider how today's transportation choices affect future generations

## 5.3. **Systematic Approaches**

- **Calculate true costs** - Include health impacts, environmental damage, and social costs when evaluating transportation
- **Support complete streets** - Advocate for infrastructure that serves all users, not just cars
- **Demand better data** - Push for transportation metrics that measure people moved, not just vehicle throughput
- **Participate in planning** - Get involved in local transportation decisions and advocate for balanced approaches

## 5.4. **Workplace Strategies**

- **Transportation benefits** - Offer transit subsidies, bike facilities, and flexible schedules
- **Location choices** - Choose office locations accessible by multiple transportation modes
- **Remote work options** - Reduce commuting dependency through flexible work arrangements
- **Delivery optimization** - Consolidate deliveries and consider off-peak times to reduce traffic impacts
- **Employee education** - Share information about transportation alternatives and their benefits

## 5.5. **Daily Life Practice**

- **Multi-modal trips** - Combine walking, biking, and transit instead of defaulting to driving
- **Car-light lifestyle** - Gradually reduce car dependency through intentional choices
- **Community engagement** - Join advocacy groups working on transportation reform
- **Lead by example** - Use alternative transportation and talk about your positive experiences
- **Educate others** - Share information about the hidden costs of car dependency

> **Remember**: Transportation isn't about cars vs. people - it's about creating systems that work for everyone. The more we question motonormative assumptions, the more we can build healthier, more equitable communities where people have real choices about how they get around.
