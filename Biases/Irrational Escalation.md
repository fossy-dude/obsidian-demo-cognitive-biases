# 1. ELI5

 When you've already spent time, money, or effort on something, it's hard to stop even when you know you should! Like continuing to eat a terrible meal just because you paid for it, or keep watching a boring movie because you've already watched half of it - you're throwing good resources after bad!

# 2. Recognizing the Bias

Ô∏è **Warning Signs to Watch For:**

- Continuing to invest money, time, or effort despite clear evidence it's not working
- Saying "I've already invested too much to quit now" or "I can't stop now"
- Feeling defensive about past decisions and avoiding admitting mistakes
- Double-downing on failing strategies instead of trying new approaches
- Calculating future success based solely on past investments rather than current reality
- Feeling trapped by your own previous commitments
- Ignoring new information that suggests you should change course

# 3. How Bias Shows Up

**Workplace Examples:**
- Continuing a failing project because the company has already spent millions on it
- Keeping underperforming employees because of the time invested in training them
- Pursuing a business strategy that's clearly failing because "we've always done it this way"
- Buying more equipment for a dying technology because of existing infrastructure
- Promoting someone to cover up a bad hiring decision rather than admitting the mistake

**Daily Life Examples:**
- Finishing a terrible book because you've already read 100 pages
- Continuing to use broken appliances because you paid a lot for them
- Staying in an unhealthy relationship because of the time already invested
- Eating food you don't like at a restaurant because you paid for it
- Watching a terrible movie to the end because you've already started it

**Financial Examples:**
- Holding onto losing stocks because you've already lost so much money
- Continuing to invest in a failing business because of startup costs
- Making additional purchases to justify a previous bad spending decision
- Doubling down on gambling losses to "win back" what you've lost
- Taking on more debt to fix a bad investment instead of cutting losses

**Personal Development Examples:**
- Sticking with a career path you hate because of your education investment
- Continuing expensive hobbies you no longer enjoy because of equipment costs
- Maintaining expensive memberships you don't use because of initiation fees
- Pursuing advanced degrees in fields you no longer want to work in

# 4. Quick Test or Checklist

 **Self-Check Questions:**

- **Fresh Perspective Test:** "If I were starting today with no prior investment, would I make the same choice?"
- **Sunk Cost Awareness:** "Am I continuing primarily because of what I've already invested?"
- **Future Focus:** "Looking forward, is this the best use of my future time/money/energy?"
- **Evidence Check:** "What does the current evidence say about future success, regardless of past efforts?"
- **Outside Opinion:** "What would I advise a friend to do in this exact situation?"

# 5. How to Counteract

Ô∏è **Practical Strategies:**

1. **Set Clear Exit Points:** Define specific criteria for when to stop before starting any project or investment
2. **Separate Past from Future:** Treat past investments as sunk costs that shouldn't influence future decisions
3. **Seek Outside Perspectives:** Ask people without emotional investment for their honest assessment
4. **Reframe Stopping as Strategic:** View quitting as smart resource allocation rather than failure
5. **Regular Reviews:** Schedule periodic evaluations of ongoing commitments without considering past investments
6. **Pre-commitment:** Make decisions about stopping points when you're emotionally neutral
7. **Focus on Opportunity Cost:** Consider what else you could achieve with those resources if you stopped

üí° **Remember:** Smart people know when to cut their losses. The resources you've already spent are gone - focus on making the best decision for your future, not your past.
