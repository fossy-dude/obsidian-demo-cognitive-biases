# 1. ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5)

Imagine you have a big bowl of different fruits. If I ask you "what's the chance this bowl has fruit?" you might say "100%." But if I ask "what's the chance it has apples?" you might say "70%," "what's the chance it has bananas?" you might say "60%," and "what's the chance it has oranges?" you might say "50%." Weirdly, sometimes we add up the chances of all the different fruits and get more than 100%, even though it's the same bowl!

Subadditivity effect is like when you think the chance of something happening in different ways is smaller than the chance of it happening in any specific way. It's like thinking "the chance of rain today" is smaller than "the chance of rain this morning plus the chance of rain this afternoon" - which doesn't make mathematical sense!

# 2. Recognizing the Bias

**Warning Signs to Watch For:**
- ðŸ”¢ You assign probabilities that don't add up mathematically (individual parts > whole)
- You judge the likelihood of general outcomes as lower than specific outcomes that are part of them
- You find yourself saying "X is unlikely, but X could happen in ways A, B, or C"
- ðŸ§© You feel more confident about specific scenarios than general scenarios that include them
- ðŸ¤” You struggle to reconcile probability assessments when looking at parts vs. wholes
- You make different decisions based on how scenarios are framed (specific vs. general)
- ðŸŽ² You underestimate comprehensive risks while overestimating specific risks

**Common Triggers:**
- Complex risk assessment scenarios
- Insurance and financial planning decisions
- Medical diagnosis and treatment choices
- Business forecasting and strategic planning
- Weather and natural disaster predictions
- Product development and market analysis

**Cognitive Red Flags:**
- "I'm not worried about X, but I'm worried about A, B, or C happening"
- "The overall risk seems low, but these specific risks concern me"
- "I don't think X will happen, but there are many ways it could occur"
- "The general case seems unlikely, but these specific cases seem possible"

# 3. How It Shows Up

## 3.1. **Workplace Examples**

**Risk Management and Planning:**
- **Project Risk Assessment**: A manager thinks "the project will probably succeed overall" (70% confidence), but then identifies specific failure modes like "technical issues" (40%), "budget overruns" (35%), "timeline delays" (45%), and "team turnover" (30%), without realizing these add up to more than the overall risk

**Probability Assessment Patterns:**
- [ ] I often assign higher probabilities to specific scenarios than to general scenarios that include them
- [ ] I find myself more worried about specific risks than overall risk categories
- [ ] I struggle to reconcile individual risk probabilities with overall risk assessments
- [ ] I make different decisions based on how scenarios are framed (specific vs. general)
- [ ] I underestimate comprehensive risks while overestimating specific risks
- [ ] I feel confident about general outcomes but anxious about specific scenarios
- [ ] I prioritize specific risks over overall risk management

**Decision-Making Indicators:**
- [ ] I focus more on specific failure modes than overall success probability
- [ ] I feel better prepared for specific scenarios than general situations
- [ ] I allocate resources to specific risks rather than comprehensive risk management
- [ ] I find it easier to plan for specific scenarios than general categories
- [ ] I make different choices based on whether risks are presented specifically or generally

**Mathematical Awareness:**

- [ ] I understand that specific scenarios should have lower probabilities than general ones
- [ ] I can recognize when my probability assessments are inconsistent
- [ ] I regularly check whether my risk assessments make mathematical sense
- [ ] I can adjust my thinking when I notice probability inconsistencies

## 4.3. **Subadditivity Awareness Scale**

**Score yourself based on the checklists above:**
- **0-5 points**: Low subadditivity effect - you consistently think probabilistically
- **6-15 points**: Moderate subadditivity effect - you sometimes focus on specifics over generals
- **16-25 points**: High subadditivity effect - you significantly overfocus on specific scenarios

**Reality Check Questions:**
1. "When assessing risks, do I feel more anxious about specific scenarios than general categories?"
2. "Can I think of examples where I assigned higher probabilities to specific outcomes than to general outcomes that include them?"
3. "Do I make different decisions based on how risk scenarios are presented (specific vs. general)?"
4. "When I list specific risks, do they add up to more than my overall risk assessment?"
5. "Do I focus more on preventing specific problems than managing overall risk?"

**The Probability Math Test**: Take a current risk assessment. List the overall probability you assign to a general category, then list probabilities for specific scenarios within that category. Check if the math makes sense.

**Remember**: The subadditivity effect is a natural consequence of how our brains process information - we're better at thinking about specific, concrete scenarios than abstract, general ones. The goal isn't to eliminate this tendency entirely, but to develop awareness and tools to ensure our probability assessments are mathematically consistent and logically sound.

**Key Insight**: The most accurate risk assessment comes from understanding both the forest and the trees - seeing the big picture while also understanding the specific components that contribute to it. By developing the ability to think at multiple levels of abstraction, we can make better decisions and more accurately assess the true nature of risks and opportunities in our lives.
