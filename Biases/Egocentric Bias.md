# 1. ELI5

Egocentric Bias is when we think our own opinions and experiences are more important or correct than others'. It's like when you really love a certain food, you assume everyone else must love it too, and you're surprised when they don't.

# 2. Recognizing the Bias

- You find yourself saying "Well, I think..." more than asking "What do you think?"
- You're surprised when people have different preferences or opinions than you
- You assume others have the same knowledge or information that you do
- You notice yourself getting defensive when someone disagrees with your perspective
- You're making decisions based on what you would want without considering others' needs
- You're using phrases like "Obviously..." or "Everyone knows..." when expressing your views

# 3. How Bias Shows Up

**Workplace Examples:**
- Managers assuming employees share their priorities and motivations
- Team leaders making decisions based on their own work style preferences
- Salespeople focusing on product features they personally find impressive rather than customer needs
- Presenters using technical jargon they understand without considering audience knowledge levels

**Daily Life Examples:**
- Assuming everyone shares your political or social views
- Being shocked when friends don't like your favorite movie or restaurant
- Planning social activities based solely on your own interests
- Giving advice based on what would work for you rather than the other person's situation

**Financial Examples:**
- Financial advisors recommending investment strategies that match their own risk tolerance
- Business owners assuming customers value the same things they do
- Investors buying stocks in companies they personally like regardless of fundamentals
- Parents making financial decisions for children based on their own generational values

**Decision Making Examples:**
- Voters assuming all reasonable people must agree with their political stance
- Parents choosing parenting approaches based on what worked for them as children
- Travelers planning trips based on their own preferences rather than their travel companions
- Leaders making policy decisions based on their personal experiences rather than diverse community needs

# 4. Quick Test or Checklist

**Self-Check Questions:**
- When was the last time I asked someone else's opinion before making a decision?
- Do I assume people who disagree with me are wrong, or do I consider their perspective?
- How often do I use phrases like "I think" vs "What do you think?"
- When I'm surprised by someone's reaction, do I try to understand their viewpoint?
- Do I consider different backgrounds and experiences when discussing topics with others?

**Warning Signs:**
- [ ] I'm finishing other people's sentences because I assume I know what they'll say
- [ ] I'm using "we" when I really mean "I" (assuming everyone agrees with me)
- [ ] I'm getting defensive when challenged rather than curious about other views
- [ ] I'm planning group activities without asking for input
- [ ] I'm giving unsolicited advice based on what works for me

# 5. How to Counteract

**ðŸ‘‚ Practice Active Perspective-Taking:**
- **Ask more questions** than you make statements - "What do you think about this?"
- **Practice reflective listening** - repeat back what others say to ensure understanding
- **Use "I" statements** instead of generalizations - "I prefer this" vs "This is better"
- **Seek out diverse viewpoints** intentionally, especially from people different from you

** Challenge Your Assumptions:**
- **Ask "What am I missing?"** regularly to acknowledge your blind spots
- **Play devil's advocate** with your own opinions to test their strength
- **Consider the opposite** - what if your least preferred option is actually best?
- **Seek feedback** from people who disagree with you to understand their reasoning

** Build Empathy and Awareness:**
- **Read widely** from authors with different backgrounds and perspectives
- **Travel to new places** to experience different cultures and ways of thinking
- **Talk to strangers** to learn about lives and experiences different from yours
- **Keep a perspective journal** noting when you're surprised by others' viewpoints

**Implement Structural Changes:**
- **Use decision frameworks** that require multiple perspectives before finalizing
- **Create diverse teams** that bring different experiences and viewpoints
- **Establish feedback systems** that encourage honest disagreement
- **Set meeting norms** that ensure everyone speaks before decisions are made
- **Use anonymous input methods** to reduce ego-driven group dynamics
