# 1. ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5)

Imagine your friend tells you they saw a dinosaur in the park. Even though you know dinosaurs are extinct, part of you still wants to believe them because they're your friend and friends usually tell the truth!

Truth bias is like that - our brains automatically tend to believe what people tell us, even when we should be more careful about questioning whether it's actually true or not.

# 2. Recognizing the Bias

Truth Bias is Our Automatic Tendency to Believe that People Are Telling the Truth, even when there Might Be Reasons to Be Skeptical. This Bias Operates as a Cognitive Default that Makes Us Vulnerable to Deception

**Warning Signs You're Experiencing Truth Bias:**

- **"They would never lie to me"** - Automatically assuming honesty from people you like or trust
- **Immediate acceptance** - Believing information without questioning or verification
- **Benefit of the doubt overload** - Giving people the benefit of doubt even when evidence suggests caution
- **Trust by default** - Starting from assumption of truth rather than skepticism
- **Suspicion discomfort** - Feeling bad or guilty about doubting someone's word
- **Authority truth assumption** - Believing statements from authority figures without critical evaluation
- **Confirmation bias in action** - Accepting information that confirms what you want to believe

# 4. Quick Test or Checklist

**Self-Assessment Questions:**

1. **The Automatic Belief Test**: When someone tells you something surprising, do you tend to believe it immediately unless you have a strong reason not to?
2. **The Verification Check**: How often do you verify information people tell you before acting on it?
3. **The Trust Assessment**: Do you find it difficult to doubt people you like or respect, even when something seems off?
4. **The Red Flag Recognition**: When you catch someone in one lie, do you still tend to believe their other statements?

**Decision Review Checklist:**
- [ ] Do I automatically assume people are telling me the truth?
