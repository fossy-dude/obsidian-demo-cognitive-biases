# 1. ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5)

Imagine you're choosing between a small ice cream cone for $2 and a big one for $5. It's a hard choice! But then they show you a tiny cone for $1.50 that's barely any ice cream. Suddenly the $2 cone seems like a great deal!

The decoy effect is when someone adds a third option that's not very good just to make one of the other two choices look much better than it really is.

# 2. Recognizing the Bias

The Decoy Effect is a Cognitive Bias where Consumers Tend to Change Their Preference between Two Options when Presented with a Third Option (the "decoy") that is Asymmetrically Dominated

**Key Warning Signs You're Experiencing This Bias:**

**Pricing & Purchase Patterns:**
- You suddenly prefer option A when option B is introduced, even though nothing about option A changed
- You find yourself choosing something that seems "obviously better" when a third option makes it look good
- You notice prices that seem strategically placed to make other options look reasonable
- You feel like you're getting a "great deal" compared to another option, but not compared to the market

**Decision-Making Red Flags:**
- You make quick decisions when faced with three options where one seems clearly inferior
- You focus on comparing two options while barely noticing the third one
- You feel confident about your choice because it "beats" another option, not because it's objectively best
- You notice retailers highlighting certain comparisons between products

**️ Marketing & Sales Indicators:**
- You see products displayed in sets of three where one seems like an obvious bad choice
- Salespeople emphasize comparisons between specific options while downplaying others
- Pricing seems designed to make one option look like the "sweet spot"
- You're presented with "good, better, best" options where the middle one usually gets pushed

## 2.1. **How Decoys Work**

**Asymmetric Domination**: The decoy is priced to make one option look superior in both value and features compared to the decoy, while the other option might be better in some ways but not clearly superior to the decoy.

**Attribute Framing**: Decoys emphasize specific attributes (like price or features) to make you focus on what the seller wants you to consider.

**Choice Overload**: Three options create just enough complexity to make you want to simplify by choosing the "obvious" winner.

# 3. How Bias Shows Up

## 3.1. **Workplace & Business Settings**

**Product Management & Pricing:**
- **Software Tiers**: Companies offer Basic ($10), Pro ($50), and Enterprise ($200) plans where Pro looks like the best value compared to Enterprise

# 4. Quick Test or Checklist

## 4.1. **Self-Assessment Questions**

**Core Bias Detection:**
1. Have you ever changed your preference between two options when a third, clearly inferior option was introduced?
2. Do you often find yourself choosing the "middle" option when presented with three choices?
3. Have you felt like you got a "great deal" mainly because it was better than another option, not because it was objectively good?
4. Do you notice retailers displaying products in sets of three where one seems like an obvious bad choice?
5. Have you ever made a purchase because it seemed like the "sweet spot" between too cheap and too expensive?

**Advanced Detection Scenarios:**
6. **The Coffee Shop Test**: You're deciding between small ($2) and large ($4) coffee. When they show you a mini ($1.50) that's tiny, do you suddenly feel the small is the perfect choice?
7. **The Electronics Store Scenario**: You're looking at phones: Budget ($300), Mid-range ($600), Premium ($1,000). Do you find the mid-range option suddenly very appealing?
8. **The Restaurant Menu Effect**: When you see appetizers: Small ($8), Medium ($12), Large ($18), do you often choose the medium because it seems like the best value?
9. **The Subscription Service Dilemma**: You're choosing between Basic ($10/month) and Premium ($25/month). When they show you Basic Lite ($8/month) with fewer features, does the Basic plan suddenly seem perfect?

**Scoring Your Decoy Effect Susceptibility:**

- **0-2 "yes" answers**: Low susceptibility - You're generally good at evaluating options independently
- **3-5 "yes" answers**: Moderate susceptibility - You're sometimes influenced by decoy options
- **6-9 "yes" answers**: High susceptibility - You're frequently swayed by decoy effects in your decisions

## 4.2. **Behavioral Checklist**

**Monitor These Patterns:**
- [ ] I often choose the middle option when presented with three choices
- [ ] I've changed my preference when a third, clearly inferior option was introduced
- [ ] I tend to compare options relative to each other rather than on their absolute merits
- [ ] I feel like I'm getting a good deal mainly because one option is clearly worse
- [ ] I notice retailers strategically placing products to make certain options look better

** Quick Reality Checks:**

**The Remove the Decoy Test**: If you remove the third option, would you still make the same choice between the remaining two?

**The Independent Evaluation**: Evaluate each option on its own merits, not just in comparison to others. Does your preferred choice still seem best?

**The Price-Value Analysis**: Calculate the actual value you're getting per dollar spent, ignoring how it compares to other options.

**The Market Research**: Check what similar products or services cost elsewhere. Is your choice really the best value, or just the best in this particular set?

**Remember**: The decoy effect works because it simplifies complex decisions by making one option seem obviously superior. By being aware of this tactic, you can make more rational choices based on your actual needs and budget.
