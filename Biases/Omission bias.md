# 1. ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5)

Imagine you see two friends who both have a cookie that belongs to someone else. One friend takes the cookie and eats it. The other friend just watches the cookie get taken by someone else without saying anything. Even though both cookies are gone, most people think the friend who took it is "badder" than the friend who did nothing.

Omission bias is when we think doing something bad is worse than not doing something good, even when both lead to the same bad result!

# 2. Recognizing the Bias

Omission bias is the tendency to judge harmful actions more harshly than equally harmful failures to act, even when the consequences are identical.

**Key Warning Signs You're Experiencing This Bias:**

**Internal Thought Patterns:**
- "At least I didn't make it worse" (when you could have made it better)
- "I didn't do anything wrong" (when you failed to do something right)
- "It's not my fault, I wasn't involved" (when you chose not to get involved)
- "I didn't cause the problem" (ignoring that you could have prevented it)

**Behavioral Indicators:**
- You feel less guilty about not helping than about accidentally hurting
- You prefer to "let nature take its course" rather than intervene
- You avoid making decisions because inaction feels safer than action
- You judge people more harshly for mistakes of commission than omission
- You feel morally superior for "not getting involved" in difficult situations

**️ Emotional Red Flags:**
- Feeling relieved when you avoid taking action that might have helped
- Experiencing less guilt about failing to prevent harm than about causing it
- Feeling morally justified in your inaction during others' suffering
- Becoming defensive when someone suggests you should have helped

# 4. Quick Test or Checklist

## 4.1. **Self-Assessment Questions**

**Core Bias Detection:**
1. Would you feel guiltier about accidentally breaking someone's vase or about failing to prevent someone else from breaking it?
2. Do you feel morally superior when you "stay out of" other people's conflicts?
3. Would you rather risk doing harm by acting or risk allowing harm by not acting?
4. Do you judge politicians more for bad decisions they made than for good decisions they failed to make?

**Advanced Detection Scenarios:**
5. **The Medical Dilemma**: If a treatment has a 5% chance of causing death but a 95% chance of saving a life, would you avoid it because you couldn't live with being the one who "caused" death?
6. **The Financial Test**: Would you feel worse about losing money by making a bad investment than by missing out on a good investment?
7. **The Parenting Paradox**: Do you hesitate to discipline your children because you fear making things worse more than you fear the consequences of not disciplining?
8. **The Bystander Effect**: In an emergency, would you hesitate to help because you fear doing something wrong more than you fear doing nothing?

**Scoring Your Omission Bias:**

- **0-2 "yes" answers**: Low bias - You generally evaluate actions and inactions based on outcomes
- **3-4 "yes" answers**: Moderate bias - You sometimes favor inaction over action to avoid blame
- **5-8 "yes" answers**: High bias - You strongly prefer omission to commission, even when harmful

## 4.2. **Behavioral Checklist**

**Monitor These Patterns:**
- [ ] I often say "It's better not to get involved" in difficult situations
- [ ] I feel less guilty about not helping than about helping poorly
- [ ] I judge others more for what they do than for what they fail to do
- [ ] I prefer "letting nature take its course" over intervention
- [ ] I avoid making decisions because inaction feels morally safer

** Quick Reality Checks:**

**The Consequence Test**: Before choosing inaction, ask: "What harm might come from not acting, and am I treating this harm as seriously as I would if I caused it directly?"

**The Role Reversal**: "If someone else failed to act in this situation, how would I judge their inaction?"

**The Moral Math**: "Is the potential harm from inaction really less than the potential harm from action, or does it just feel that way?"

**The Future Test**: "How will I feel about my inaction if things go badly, compared to how I'd feel if I acted and things went badly?"

**Remember**: Inaction is a choice too - and sometimes it's the more harmful choice. The key is to evaluate both paths by their consequences, not by whether you "did something."

# 5. How to Counteract ️

## 5.1. Decision-Making Frameworks 🤔

- **Consequence-based thinking**: Focus on outcomes rather than actions vs. inactions
- **Active consideration**: Treat "doing nothing" as an active choice with its own consequences
- **Moral symmetry**: Apply the same moral standards to omissions as you do to commissions
- **Responsibility expansion**: Recognize that responsibility includes preventing harm, not just avoiding causing it

## 5.2. Perspective-Shifting Exercises

- **The observer test**: Imagine someone else in your situation - would you judge their inaction as harshly as their action?
- **The future self**: Ask "How will I feel about this choice looking back in 10 years?"
- **The harm comparison**: Explicitly compare the potential harm of action vs. inaction
- **The role model question**: "What would someone I admire do in this situation?"

## 5.3. Action Strategies

- **Default to action**: When in doubt, lean toward helpful action rather than passive observation
- **Start small**: Begin with low-stakes interventions to build confidence in taking action
- **Embrace imperfection**: Accept that helping imperfectly is better than not helping at all
- **Practice calculated risk**: Learn to evaluate when the potential benefits of action outweigh the risks

## 5.4. Communication & Accountability

- **Speak up**: Share your perspective even if you're not 100% sure it's right
- **Ask questions**: Gather more information rather than remaining silent
- **Admit mistakes**: Be willing to acknowledge when your actions cause problems
- **Seek feedback**: Ask others whether your inaction might have contributed to negative outcomes

## 5.5. Workplace Implementation

- **In meetings**: Contribute your ideas rather than staying silent to avoid being wrong
- **In conflicts**: Mediate rather than remaining neutral when people are being harmed
- **In innovation**: Suggest improvements rather than maintaining the status quo
- **In leadership**: Take responsibility for team outcomes, whether through action or inaction

## 5.6. Daily Life Practice

- **In emergencies**: Learn basic first aid and be willing to help even if you're not an expert
- **In relationships**: Address issues rather than letting them fester
- **In community**: Get involved in local issues rather than staying uninvolved
- **In personal growth**: Try new things rather than sticking only to what's comfortable

## 5.7. Ethical Decision Making

- **Consider duties**: Recognize that we often have duties to help, not just duties to avoid harm
- **Evaluate impact**: Focus on the actual impact on others rather than on your own moral comfort
- **Accept responsibility**: Take ownership of both your actions and your conscious inactions
- **Practice courage**: Develop the moral courage to act when action is needed, even when it's risky

> **Remember**: Sometimes the most moral choice is to act, even when acting carries risks. The goal isn't to avoid all blame, but to create the best possible outcomes for everyone involved. Inaction is a choice - make it consciously, not by default.
