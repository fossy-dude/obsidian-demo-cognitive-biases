# 1. ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5)

 Imagine you think your friends are always predictable - like how Sarah always loves pizza and Mike always tells jokes. But when it comes to yourself, you believe you're full of surprises and can be different every day!

Trait ascription bias is when we see other people as having fixed, predictable personalities while thinking of ourselves as complex and ever-changing. It's like believing everyone else is a simple picture book, but you're an entire library with endless stories! 📚

## 1.1. Recognizing the Bias

️ **You might be experiencing this bias when:**

- You say "Oh, that's so typical of them!" but never "That's so typical of me!"
- You're surprised when someone acts "out of character" but expect others to understand your own mood changes
- You describe others with simple labels ("she's shy," "he's aggressive") but see yourself as nuanced
- You believe you have good reasons for your actions, but others are just "being themselves"
- You think your personality is situational, but others' personalities are permanent

**Key phrases that signal trait ascription bias:**
- "That's just how they are"
- "I'm not usually like this, but..."
- "They always do that"
- "I'm complicated, they're simple"
- "They never change"

## 1.2. How It Shows Up

### 1.2.1. **Workplace Examples**

- **Performance reviews**: Labeling colleagues as "lazy" or "overachievers" while giving yourself context for your performance

- **Leadership**: Thinking "I adapt my style to the situation" but "My boss is just micromanaging by nature"
- **Conflict resolution**: Believing "They're always difficult" but "I was just having a bad day"

### 1.2.2. **Daily Life Examples**

- **Friendships**: "Sarah is always late" vs. "I was delayed today because of traffic"
- **Family relationships**: "My brother is so selfish" vs. "I needed some time for myself"

- **Social media**: "They're just seeking attention" vs. "I'm sharing my authentic self"

### 1.2.3. **Financial Examples**
