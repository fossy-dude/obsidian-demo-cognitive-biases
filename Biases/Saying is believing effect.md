# 1. ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5)

Imagine you tell your friend you love broccoli because you know they like it, even though you actually think it's just okay. Later, when someone asks you about broccoli, you say "I love it!" because you forgot you were just being nice.

The saying is believing effect is like that - when we say things to fit in or make others happy, we sometimes start believing those things ourselves, even if we didn't believe them at first!

# 2. Recognizing the Bias

The Saying is Believing Effect Occurs when We Adapt Our Communication to Our Audience and then Internalize Those Adapted Messages as Our Genuine Beliefs

**Warning Signs of the Saying is Believing Effect:**
- **"I actually agree with them now"** - Changing your stated opinion after explaining it to someone who disagrees
- **"I've always thought this way"** - Claiming consistency when your position has actually evolved through social tuning
- **Post-justification certainty** - Feeling more confident about a position after you've argued it, regardless of its merit
- **Audience-dependent beliefs** - Finding your opinions change depending on who you're talking to
- **"I convinced myself"** - Realizing you now believe something you initially said just to be persuasive
- **Memory distortion** - Misremembering your original position as being closer to what you presented to others

# 4. Quick Test or Checklist

**Self-Assessment Questions:**
1. Have you ever found yourself strongly defending a position you initially took just to be polite or avoid conflict?
2. Do you notice your opinions changing depending on who you're talking to?
3. Have you ever caught yourself believing something you originally said just to impress someone?
4. Do you sometimes feel more certain about decisions after you've explained them to others?

**The Saying is Believing Test:**
- Think about a recent conversation where you adapted your message to your audience
- Do you now believe the adapted version more than your original position?
- Can you clearly remember your original opinion, or has it blurred with what you presented?
- Would you have reached the same conclusion if you'd never had to explain it to others?

**Communication Review Checklist:**
- [ ] Before adapting your message, ask: "Is this alignment or compromise?"
- [ ] After important conversations, reflect: "What did I originally believe vs. what I said?"
- [ ] Notice when you're using phrases like "I've always thought..." to justify recent position changes
- [ ] Check if your opinions shift significantly between different social contexts

# 5. How to Counteract ️

## 5.1. **Immediate Awareness**

- **Pause before adapting** - Take a moment to consider whether you're genuinely aligning your views or just socially tuning
- **Track your original positions** - Make mental or written notes of your genuine opinions before important conversations
- **Notice audience effects** - Pay attention to when and how your communication changes based on who's listening
- **Practice metacognition** - Regularly ask yourself: "Do I actually believe this, or am I saying it for social reasons?"

## 5.2. **Communication Strategies**

- **Authentic communication** - Practice expressing your genuine thoughts, even when they differ from your audience's expectations
- **Distinguish adaptation from evolution** - Recognize when you're truly changing your mind vs. just temporarily adjusting your message
- **Use qualifying language** - Instead of absolute statements, use "I'm still thinking about this..." or "My current view is..."
- **Create psychological distance** - Present ideas as "one perspective" rather than "the truth" to maintain cognitive flexibility

## 5.3. **Documentation & Reflection**

- **Journaling practice** - Keep a record of your opinions on important topics and review them periodically
- **Pre-conversation notes** - Write down your position before important discussions or presentations
- **Post-conversation reflection** - After significant conversations, compare what you said with what you actually believe
- **Feedback seeking** - Ask trusted friends to point out when they notice you adapting your opinions to social contexts

## 5.4. **Professional Applications**

- **Structured decision processes** - Use formal frameworks that require documenting reasoning before group discussions
- **Anonymous input systems** - Gather opinions privately before group discussions to establish baseline views
- **Devil's advocate roles** - Assign team members to challenge consensus positions to prevent group reinforcement

- **Authentic relationship building** - Prioritize relationships where you can express genuine opinions without social pressure
- **Mindful communication** - Practice speaking authentically while still being respectful of others

## 5.6. **Cognitive Training**

- **Perspective-taking exercises** - Practice understanding others' viewpoints without adopting them as your own
- **Cognitive flexibility training** - Learn to hold multiple perspectives simultaneously without committing to one
- **Critical thinking practice** - Regularly question your own beliefs and the reasons you hold them

> **Remember**: The saying is believing effect is a natural part of social communication. The goal isn't to eliminate social adaptation entirely—that would make us isolated and ineffective. Instead, aim for awareness and intentionality: know when you're adapting your message for social reasons, and maintain clear boundaries between social performance and genuine belief.

## 5.7. **Ethical Considerations**

**Healthy vs. Problematic Adaptation:**
- **Healthy**: Adapting communication style while maintaining core beliefs
- **Problematic**: Completely changing stated beliefs to fit social context
- **Healthy**: Finding common ground while acknowledging differences
- **Problematic**: Pretending to agree on fundamental issues just to avoid conflict

**Building Authentic Communication:**
- **Start small**: Practice expressing minor genuine opinions in safe situations
- **Build confidence**: As you become more comfortable with authentic expression, expand to more important topics
- **Respect boundaries**: Learn to disagree respectfully without compromising relationships
- **Accept discomfort**: Recognize that authentic communication sometimes creates temporary discomfort but leads to better long-term outcomes
