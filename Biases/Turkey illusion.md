# 1. ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5)

🦃 Imagine a turkey who gets fed every day by the farmer. Day after day, the turkey thinks "The farmer always feeds me and takes care of me, so tomorrow will be just like today!" But then one day... it's Thanksgiving! 😱

The turkey illusion is when we expect patterns to continue forever, even when there might be a sudden, unexpected change coming. It's like assuming the sun will always shine just because it has been sunny all week! ☀️

## 1.1. Recognizing the Bias

️ **You might be experiencing this bias when:**

- You say "This has always worked before, so it will keep working"
- You ignore warning signs because "things have been going so well"
- You're shocked when a long-running system suddenly fails
- You believe "steady growth" means "infinite growth"
- You dismiss concerns about change because "we've always done it this way"

**Key phrases that signal turkey illusion:**
- "It's always been like this"
- "This trend will continue forever"
- "Nothing ever changes around here"
- "We've never had problems before"
- "It's working perfectly, why change?"

## 1.2. How It Shows Up
