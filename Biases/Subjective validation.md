# 1. ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5)

Imagine you really, really want a cookie. If someone says "cookies are healthy," you might believe them right away because you want it to be true! But if someone says "cookies are bad for you," you might think "they don't know what they're talking about."

Subjective validation is like having special glasses that only let you see things you already believe are true. When you hear something that matches what you want to believe, it feels super true. But when you hear something different, your brain says "nope, that can't be right!" It's like being a detective who only looks for clues that prove what you already think happened!

# 2. Recognizing the Bias

**Warning Signs to Watch For:**
- You accept information without question when it confirms what you want to believe
- ‚ùå You immediately reject or question information that contradicts your desired beliefs
- You use different standards to evaluate information based on whether it supports your views
- You actively seek evidence that validates your beliefs while ignoring contradictory evidence
- üé≠ You find yourself saying "I knew it!" when information confirms your suspicions
- Ô∏è You get defensive or angry when your beliefs are challenged
- You remember confirming evidence vividly while forgetting or discounting disconfirming evidence

**Common Triggers:**
- Personal identity and self-image beliefs
- Political and ideological convictions
- Religious and spiritual beliefs
- Health and wellness decisions
- Investment and financial choices
- Relationship and interpersonal judgments

**Cognitive Red Flags:**
- "That makes sense to me" (when hearing confirming information)
- "I don't believe that" (when hearing disconfirming information)
- "See, I told you so!" (when encountering confirmation)
- "They must be biased/wrong/misguided" (when encountering contradiction)
- "This feels right" (as a primary criterion for truth)
- "I just know it's true" (without substantial evidence)

# 3. How It Shows Up

## 4.3. **Subjective Validation Awareness Scale**

**Score yourself based on the checklists above:**
- **0-5 points**: Low subjective validation - you consistently evaluate information objectively
- **6-15 points**: Moderate subjective validation - you sometimes let beliefs influence information processing
- **16-25 points**: High subjective validation - your desires significantly influence how you evaluate information

**Reality Check Questions:**
1. "When I encounter information that supports my beliefs, how quickly do I accept it?"
2. "How do I react when information contradicts my strongly held beliefs?"
3. "Do I seek out sources that challenge my existing beliefs?"
4. "Can I articulate the strongest arguments against positions I hold?"
5. "Do I apply the same critical standards to information I agree with and disagree with?"

**The Belief Challenge Test**: Take one of your strongly held beliefs and spend 15 minutes genuinely researching the strongest arguments against it. Notice your emotional and cognitive reactions.

**Key Insight**: The truth doesn't care about your preferences or desires. The most reliable path to accurate understanding isn't finding evidence that confirms what you want to believe - it's developing the courage and skills to follow the evidence wherever it leads, even when it takes you to uncomfortable places.
