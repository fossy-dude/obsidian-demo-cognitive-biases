# 1. ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5)

 Imagine you're feeling really happy, like when you get ice cream! When you're happy, you might remember all the other fun times you had - like birthday parties and playing with friends.

But if you're feeling sad, you might remember all the times you scraped your knee or when your toy broke. Your brain likes to match your mood with your memories!

The mood-congruent memory bias is when your current feelings act like colored glasses - happy glasses help you see happy memories, and sad glasses help you see sad memories. It's like your brain is playing a matching game with how you feel right now! 😊😔

## 1.1. Recognizing the Bias

️ **You might be experiencing this bias when:**

- Your memories seem to match your current emotional state
- You have trouble remembering positive things when you're sad
- When happy, you forget about past problems and difficulties
- Your回忆 of past events changes based on how you feel today
- You're convinced "everything always goes wrong" during bad moods
- You believe "everything always works out" during good moods
- Your perspective on life shifts dramatically with your mood

**Key phrases that signal mood-congruent thinking:**
- "I can't remember the last time I was happy"
- "Nothing ever goes right for me"
- "Everything always works out in the end"
- "Life has always been this hard/easy"
- "I've never been this sad/happy before"

## 1.2. How It Shows Up
