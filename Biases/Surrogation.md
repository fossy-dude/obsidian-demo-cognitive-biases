# 1. ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5)

Imagine your teacher wants you to learn "kindness" - that's the real goal. But instead of teaching kindness, they just give you a sticker every time you say "please" and "thank you."

Soon, you might start thinking that saying "please" and "thank you" IS kindness, rather than just being signs of kindness. You might collect stickers without actually being kind to others!

Surrogation is when we forget what we're really trying to measure and start focusing only on the measurement itself. It's like thinking the map IS the territory, or confusing the thermometer with the actual temperature! 🗺️

## 1.1. Recognizing the Bias

️ **You might be experiencing this bias when:**

- You focus more on hitting numerical targets than achieving the actual goal
- You game the system to get good scores rather than improve performance
- You mistake metrics for reality or indicators for outcomes
- You optimize for what's easy to measure rather than what's important
- You defend metrics even when they're clearly not working
- You forget the original purpose behind the measurements

**Key phrases that signal surrogation:**
- "We need to hit our numbers"
- "The metrics look good"
- "We're meeting our targets"
- "The score is what matters"
- "We need to improve the KPI"

## 1.2. How It Shows Up

### 1.2.1. **Workplace Examples**

- **Customer service**: Focusing on call times instead of actually solving customer problems
- **Sales teams**: Chasing commission targets rather than building long-term client relationships
- **Quality control**: Meeting defect rate quotas while ignoring serious customer complaints
- **Employee evaluations**: Judging based on hours worked rather than actual contributions
- **Project management**: Hitting deadlines while delivering poor quality work

### 1.2.2. **Daily Life Examples**

- **Fitness tracking**: Counting steps instead of actual health improvements
- **Social media**: Focusing on follower counts rather than meaningful connections
- **Academic grades**: Memorizing for tests instead of actual learning
- **Dieting**: Counting calories without considering nutritional quality
- **Environmental impact**: Focusing on recycling while ignoring larger consumption issues

### 1.2.3. **Financial Examples**

- **Investment performance**: Chasing quarterly returns instead of long-term growth
- **Business valuation**: Focusing on stock price rather than company health
- **Credit scores**: Maintaining good credit by avoiding necessary debt
- **Budget tracking**: Coming in under budget while cutting essential services
- **Tax planning**: Minimizing taxes at the expense of legitimate business needs

## 1.3. Quick Test

**Scenario 1**: A hospital's goal is "patient health and satisfaction." They start measuring "time spent with each patient" as a proxy. Soon, doctors are spending exactly 15 minutes with each patient, no more, no less. What's happening?
A) They're improving patient care efficiently
B) They're confusing the measure with the goal
C) They're optimizing for patient satisfaction

**Scenario 2**: Your company wants "innovative thinking" but measures "number of new ideas submitted." Employees start submitting hundreds of trivial ideas. What's the issue?
A) They're being more innovative
B) They're gaming the metric instead of innovating
C) They need better idea tracking

**Scenario 3**: A school aims to create "lifelong learners" but tests only "memorization of facts." Students cram for tests and forget everything afterward. What bias is this?
A) Good teaching practice
B) Effective assessment
C) Surrogation - confusing testing with learning

## 1.4. How to Counteract

### 1.4.1. **Immediate Strategies**

- **Reconnect with purpose**: Regularly ask "what are we really trying to achieve?"
- **Use multiple measures**: Never rely on a single metric for important goals
- **Review proxy relationships**: Check if your measures still relate to your goals
- **Seek qualitative feedback**: Balance numbers with real-world experiences
- **Question the metrics**: Ask "is this helping us achieve our real goal?"

### 1.4.2. 🛠️ **Long-term Habits**

- **Regular goal reviews**: Periodically reassess whether metrics still serve their purpose
- **Balanced scorecards**: Use multiple complementary measurements
- **Outcome-focused thinking**: Always start with the desired end result
- **Metric hygiene**: Regularly retire or revise metrics that become disconnected
- **Stakeholder feedback**: Get input from those affected by your measurements

### 1.4.3. **Workplace Applications**

- **Lead and lag indicators**: Use both predictive and results-based metrics
- **Regular metric audits**: Review whether KPIs still drive desired behaviors
- **Value-based alignment**: Ensure metrics support organizational values, not just numbers
- **Holistic evaluation**: Consider multiple dimensions of performance
- **Flexible goal setting**: Adjust metrics based on changing circumstances

### 1.4.4. **Daily Life Solutions**

- **Define true success**: Clarify what really matters to you beyond easy measurements
- **Process over outcomes**: Focus on the journey, not just the destination metrics
- **Multiple success indicators**: Track various aspects of progress, not just numbers
- **Regular reflection**: Take time to assess if your measures are serving your real goals
- **Balance quantitative and qualitative**: Use both numbers and feelings to evaluate progress

**Quick Test Answers:**
1. B - They're confusing the measure with the goal (time spent ≠ quality care)
2. B - They're gaming the metric instead of innovating (quantity ≠ quality innovation)
3. C - Surrogation - confusing testing with learning (test scores ≠ actual learning)

> "Not everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can be counted counts." - Albert Einstein

Remember: The map is not the territory, and the thermometer is not the temperature! Always keep your eyes on the real goal, not just the measurements.

**Key Takeaway**: Surrogation happens when we fall in love with our metrics and forget what we were really trying to achieve in the first place. Stay connected to your true purpose!
