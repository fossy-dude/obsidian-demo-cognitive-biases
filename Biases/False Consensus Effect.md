# 1. ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5)

Imagine you love strawberry ice cream. You think "everyone must love strawberry ice cream too!" So you ask your friends, and you're surprised when some people prefer chocolate or vanilla instead.

The False Consensus Effect is when we believe that what we think, feel, or do is also what most other people think, feel, or do. We project our own preferences onto others as if they're universal truths.

# 2. Recognizing the Bias

**Key Signs You're Experiencing False Consensus Effect:**

- You say "obviously" or "everyone knows" when sharing your opinion
- You're genuinely surprised when people disagree with you
- You assume others would make the same choices you would
- You surround yourself with like-minded people and forget others exist
- You use your personal experience as evidence for what "people" generally believe

**Why Your Brain Does This:**
- Your brain wants to feel normal and part of the group
- It's easier to assume others think like you than to consider different perspectives
- Your personal experiences feel more real and valid than abstract statistics
- You tend to notice and remember people who agree with you more than those who don't

# 3. How It Shows Up

## 3.1. **Workplace Scenarios**

- **Meeting Planning**: "Obviously everyone wants to meet at 9 AM" (ignoring night owls and parents with school runs)
- **Project Management**: "This feature is definitely what users want" (without actual user research)
- **Communication Style**: "Direct feedback is best for everyone" (disregarding cultural or personality differences)
- **Tech Preferences**: "Everyone prefers Slack over email" (assuming your tech-savvy circle represents all coworkers)

## 3.2. **Daily Life Examples**

- **Food Choices**: "Who wouldn't love spicy food?" (forgetting about taste sensitivities)
- **Entertainment**: "This movie is amazing, everyone will love it!" (ignoring different genre preferences)
- **Social Events**: "Everyone loves big parties" (overlooking introverts and anxiety sufferers)
- **Exercise**: "Working out at 6 AM is the best way to start the day" (not considering different schedules and body clocks)

## 3.3. **Financial Decisions**

- **Investing**: "Real estate is always a good investment" (projecting your positive experience)
- **Spending Habits**: "Everyone budgets this way" (assuming your financial approach is standard)
- **Risk Tolerance**: "This business investment isn't that risky" (underestimating others' risk aversion)
- **Retirement Planning**: "Everyone should max out their 401(k)" (ignoring varying financial situations)

# 4. Quick Test

ü§î **Self-Assessment Questions:**

1. When you discover someone has a different political view, do you:
   - A) Try to understand their perspective
   - B) Feel surprised they don't see things "the right way"

2. When planning a group activity, do you:
   - A) Ask everyone for their preferences
   - B) Assume most people will like what you like

3. When someone disagrees with you, is your first thought:
   - A) "Interesting, I wonder why they think that"
   - B) "That's strange, most people agree with me"

4. When making decisions for others, do you:
   - A) Research what different groups might prefer
   - B) Use your own preferences as the default

5. When you hear about a popular trend you dislike, do you:
   - A) Acknowledge it's popular despite your feelings
   - B) Wonder "who actually likes this stuff?"

**Scoring:** More B answers suggest stronger False Consensus Effect tendencies.

# 5. How to Counteract

**Key Insight**: False consensus effect limits your growth and understanding by creating an echo chamber of your own beliefs. Breaking free from this bias opens up new possibilities, deeper relationships, and more effective decision-making. The most successful people are those who can see beyond their own perspective and appreciate the value of diverse viewpoints.
