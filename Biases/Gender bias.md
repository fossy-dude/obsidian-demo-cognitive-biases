# 1. ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5)

Imagine you're in a toy store and someone says "pink toys are for girls, blue toys are for boys." üëßüë¶ But actually, any child can play with any color toy they like!

Gender bias is when people make assumptions about what someone can do, should do, or likes based on whether they're a boy or girl, man or woman. These assumptions aren't fair because they limit people's choices and opportunities based on something that doesn't determine their abilities or interests.

# 2. Recognizing the Bias

## 2.1. Key Signs to Watch For

**Assumption-Based Decisions**: Making assumptions about someone's abilities, interests, or suitability based on their gender rather than their individual qualities.

**Stereotypical Language**: Using gendered language like "men are better at math" or "women are more nurturing" without considering individual differences.

**Role Expectations**: Expecting people to fulfill certain roles or behaviors based on traditional gender norms (e.g., expecting women to take meeting notes or men to handle technical issues).

 **Unequal Treatment**: Providing different opportunities, feedback, or resources to people based on gender rather than merit.

 **Double Standards**: Applying different standards or expectations to people based on their gender (e.g., criticizing a woman for being "aggressive" while praising the same behavior in a man).

## 2.2. Common Warning Flags

- You catch yourself thinking "that's not typical for someone of their gender"
- You use gendered terms when describing job roles or responsibilities
- You make assumptions about someone's personal life or career choices based on their gender
- You notice that meetings or conversations are dominated by one gender
- You find yourself treating people differently based on their gender without realizing it
- You use phrases like "man up" or "act like a lady" to enforce gendered behaviors
- You assume someone's capabilities based on gender rather than their actual skills or experience

## 2.3. Subtle Indicators

- You're surprised when someone doesn't conform to gender stereotypes in their interests or abilities
- You interrupt or speak over people of a particular gender more frequently
- You give more credit or recognition to one gender for the same work
- You make assumptions about someone's career progression or work-life balance based on gender
- You use different language or tone when speaking to people of different genders

# 3. How It Shows Up

## 3.1. Workplace Examples

- **Hiring Decisions**: A manager assumes a male candidate is more suitable for a technical leadership role, while automatically considering a female candidate for a support or administrative position, regardless of their actual qualifications and experience.
- **Meeting Dynamics**: In team meetings, women's ideas are often ignored until repeated by men, who then receive credit for the same suggestions. Women are frequently asked to take notes or handle administrative tasks during meetings.
- **Performance Reviews**: Women receive feedback about their personality and communication style (e.g., "too aggressive," "needs to be more collaborative"), while men receive feedback focused on their technical skills and business results.
- **Promotion Patterns**: Qualified women are overlooked for promotion because managers assume they won't want more responsibility due to family commitments, while men are assumed to be ready for advancement regardless of their personal circumstances.
- **Salary Negotiations**: Women who negotiate salaries are viewed negatively and penalized, while men who negotiate the same way are seen as confident and rewarded.

## 3.2. Daily Life Scenarios

- **Household Responsibilities**: In families, women are automatically expected to handle childcare, cleaning, and emotional labor, while men are expected to handle finances and home repairs, regardless of individual skills or preferences.
- **Social Interactions**: Men are consistently asked to lift heavy objects or handle "manly" tasks, while women are expected to be more nurturing and emotionally supportive in social situations.
- **Parenting Judgments**: Mothers face criticism for working too much or being too involved with their children, while fathers receive praise for basic parenting tasks that mothers do routinely.
- **Hobby and Interest Assumptions**: People express surprise when men enjoy cooking or arts, or when women enjoy sports, technology, or traditionally masculine hobbies.
- **Safety and Independence**: Women receive warnings about walking alone at night, while men are encouraged to be independent and adventurous without similar safety concerns.

## 3.3. Financial Decision-Making üí∞

- **Investment Advice**: Financial advisors often give different advice to men and women, assuming women are more risk-averse and need more guidance, while men are encouraged to take more investment risks.
- **Credit and Loan Decisions**: Loan officers may unconsciously view women as less creditworthy or more likely to prioritize family over career, affecting lending decisions.
- **Insurance Premiums**: Insurance companies sometimes charge different rates based on gender assumptions about driving behavior or health risks.
- **Financial Literacy**: Society assumes men are naturally better at managing money and investments, while women are presumed to need more help and education in financial matters.
- **Business Funding**: Female entrepreneurs often face more skepticism and scrutiny when seeking venture capital or business loans compared to their male counterparts.

## 3.4. Educational and Social Impact

- **Academic Subject Selection**: Teachers and parents may steer girls away from STEM subjects and boys away from arts and humanities based on gender stereotypes rather than individual aptitudes.
- **Classroom Participation**: Boys are often called on more frequently in class, especially in technical subjects, while girls may be praised for being quiet and compliant.
- **Sports and Physical Activity**: Girls may be discouraged from competitive sports, while boys may be pressured to participate in athletics even if they prefer other activities.
- **Media Representation**: Movies, TV shows, and advertisements frequently portray women in caregiving roles and men in leadership or technical roles, reinforcing gender stereotypes.
- **Healthcare Treatment**: Medical professionals may dismiss women's pain symptoms as emotional or psychological, while taking men's similar complaints more seriously.
