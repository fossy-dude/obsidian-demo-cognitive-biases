# 1. ELI5

Naive realism is like when you wear red-tinted glasses but forget you're wearing them, so you think everything really is red. It's when you believe that you see the world exactly as it truly is, while everyone else who sees things differently must be confused, biased, or wrong. Your brain tricks you into thinking your perspective is the "correct" one and other people's views are distorted versions of reality.

# 2. Recognizing the Bias

**Warning Signs in Your Thinking:**
- You believe you're being completely objective while others are clearly biased
- You find yourself saying "I'm just stating the facts" when expressing opinions
- You assume people who disagree with you must have some hidden agenda or motive
- You're surprised when reasonable people see the same situation differently
- You think your interpretation of events is the "correct" one

**Physical & Behavioral Indicators:**
- Getting frustrated when others don't see what seems "obvious" to you
- Dismissing alternative perspectives without serious consideration
- Using phrases like "It's just common sense" or "Anyone can see that"
- Feeling intellectually superior to those who disagree with you
- Reacting defensively when your objectivity is questioned

# 3. How Bias Shows Up

## 3.1. **Workplace Scenarios**

- A manager believes their assessment of an employee's performance is completely objective, while other managers' evaluations are "too subjective"
- During meetings, you think your analysis of a problem is the clear, logical one while others are overcomplicating things
- You assume your interpretation of company policy is correct and anyone who disagrees just didn't read it carefully enough
- When reviewing candidates for a job, you believe your hiring criteria are purely merit-based while others are influenced by personal preferences

## 3.2. **Daily Life Examples**

- You're shocked that your friends don't love your favorite movie because it's "obviously" a masterpiece
- You believe your political views are based on facts and logic, while others are driven by emotion or propaganda
- When arguing with your partner, you're convinced you're being reasonable while they're being emotional
- You think your taste in music, food, or art is objectively superior to others' preferences
- You can't understand why intelligent people would follow different religious or philosophical beliefs

## 3.3. **Financial Decision Making**

- You believe your investment strategy is clearly rational while others are making emotional decisions
- When discussing economic policy, you think your position is based on sound economics while opposing views are ideologically driven
- You're convinced that your approach to saving and spending is the "correct" financial wisdom
- You dismiss financial advice that differs from your established beliefs as "obviously wrong"

## 3.4. **Relationship Impact**

- In arguments, you believe you're seeing the situation clearly while your partner is being unreasonable
- You assume your interpretation of a friend's actions is accurate while they're "misreading" your intentions
- You think your assessment of family dynamics is objective while others are "too close to see the truth"
- When mediating conflicts, you believe you can see both sides fairly but actually favor one perspective

# 4. Quick Test or Checklist

**Check yourself with these questions:**

ü§î **When someone disagrees with you, do you:**

- Immediately assume they must be misinformed or biased?
- Find it difficult to understand how they could possibly see things differently?
- Feel surprised that intelligent people could hold their view?
- Assume they haven't considered all the facts you have?

**Objectivity Reality Check:**
- Can you list three ways your background, experiences, or values might influence your perspective?
- Do you genuinely try to understand opposing viewpoints or just wait for your turn to speak?
- Have you ever changed your mind about something you used to feel certain about?

‚öñÔ∏è **Perspective Taking:**

- Can you argue the opposing side's position as well as your own?
- Do you seek out information that challenges your existing beliefs?
- Are you open to the possibility that you might be wrong?

# 5. How to Counteract

- **Acknowledge Your Filters**: Recognize that everyone, including you, sees the world through their own lens
- **Practice Intellectual Humility**: Remind yourself that you could be wrong, even about things you feel certain about
- **Seek Diverse Perspectives**: Actively look for different viewpoints before forming conclusions
- **Ask "Why Would Someone Think This?"**: Try to genuinely understand the reasoning behind opposing views

## 5.2. **Long-term Practices**

- **Exposure to Diversity**: Surround yourself with people who have different backgrounds, experiences, and viewpoints
- **Read Widely**: Consume media from across the political and ideological spectrum
- **Practice Perspective-Taking**: Regularly try to argue positions you disagree with
- **Keep a Bias Journal**: Note when you catch yourself assuming your view is the only reasonable one

## 5.3. **Mindset Shifts**

- **Everyone Has Biases**: Recognizing your own biases is the first step to overcoming them
- **Reality is Complex**: Most situations can be reasonably interpreted in multiple ways
- **Different ‚â† Wrong**: People can reach different conclusions using the same information

## 5.4. üìã **Action Plan**

1. When you feel certain about something, pause and ask "How might I be wrong?"
2. Before arguing a point, try to state the opposing position fairly and accurately
3. Regularly expose yourself to perspectives you disagree with
4. Practice saying "I could be wrong" even (especially) when you feel confident
5. Notice when you're dismissing others' views and instead try to understand them
