# 1. ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5)

Imagine you used to hate broccoli when you were little, but now you love it. When someone asks you about it, you might say "Oh, I've always liked broccoli!" even though that's not true. ü•¶

The Consistency Bias is like that - we tend to remember our past feelings and actions as being the same as they are now, even when we've actually changed over time!

# 2. Recognizing the Bias

## 2.1. Key Signs to Watch For

**Current-State Projection**: You find yourself describing your past opinions as matching your current ones, even when you know you've changed.

**Memory Reconstruction**: When recalling past events, you automatically adjust details to align with your present beliefs and values.

**Attitude Alignment**: You assume you've always felt the same way about important topics as you do now, ignoring evidence of past different views.

 **Justification Pattern**: You explain past decisions using reasons that make sense to you now, rather than the actual reasons you had at the time.

 **Growth Narrative Smoothing**: Your personal story of change and development seems more linear and consistent than it actually was.

# 3. How It Shows Up

## 3.1. Workplace Examples

- **Career Path Rewriting**: You now love your job in marketing, so when telling your career story, you emphasize how you were "always interested in creative problem-solving" while downplaying that you initially wanted to be an accountant
- **Management Style Evolution**: You've become a collaborative leader, so you remember your early management approach as "always people-focused" even though you used to be very authoritarian
- **Company Loyalty Narrative**: You're committed to your current company, so you recall your initial job search as "knowing this was the right place" instead of remembering you were actually considering multiple offers
- **Skill Development Stories**: You're now proficient in data analysis, so you describe yourself as "always being good with numbers" despite struggling with math in school

## 3.2. Daily Life Scenarios

- **Relationship History**: You're happy in your current relationship, so you remember meeting your partner as "love at first sight" even though you had doubts and considered breaking up early on
- **Political View Alignment**: Your political views have evolved, so when discussing past elections, you recall voting consistently with your current values despite having different priorities then
- **Taste and Preference Changes**: You now enjoy healthy eating, so you claim you've "always preferred vegetables to junk food" even though you used to hate salads and love fast food
- **Hobby Development**: You're now an avid reader, so you describe yourself as "always loving books" while forgetting you barely read at all until your twenties

## 3.3. Financial Decision-Making üí∞

- **Investment Philosophy**: You're now a conservative investor, so you remember your early investment choices as "always being risk-averse" even though you made speculative bets in your youth
- **Spending Habits**: You've become frugal, so you recall your younger self as "always being careful with money" despite having been quite spendthrift
- **Career Financial Choices**: You're satisfied with your current salary trajectory, so you remember your early career decisions as "always being financially smart" even when you took lower-paying jobs for non-financial reasons
- **Retirement Planning**: You're now diligent about retirement savings, so you claim you've "always prioritized long-term financial security" despite having started saving quite late

# 4. Quick Test

## 4.1. Self-Assessment Questions

1. **The Time Machine Test**: If you could go back in time and talk to your younger self, would they be surprised by how you describe your current beliefs and attitudes?
2. **The Evidence Check**: Can you find actual proof (old journals, emails, social media posts) that supports how you remember feeling about something in the past?
3. **The Contradiction Detection**: When someone who knew you in the past contradicts your memory of your old attitudes, do you assume they're mistaken?
4. **The Change Acknowledgment**: Can you easily list ways your attitudes, beliefs, or preferences have changed significantly over the past 5-10 years?
5. **The Documentation Test**: If you found old writings or recordings of yourself, would they match your current memory of your past thoughts and feelings?

**Scoring**: If you answered "yes" to questions 1, 3, or 5, or "no" to questions 2 or 4, the Consistency Bias may be affecting your memory.

Embracing your actual journey - with all its twists, turns, and changes - leads to greater self-awareness and wisdom than maintaining an illusion of unchanging consistency.
