# 1. ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5)

Imagine you're building a LEGO tower, and it keeps falling over. Instead of starting over with a better design, you keep adding more blocks to the same wobbly tower because you've already spent so much time on it! üèóÔ∏è You think, "I can't quit now‚ÄîI've already used all these blocks!"

Escalation of commitment is like that‚Äîwhen people keep putting more time, money, or effort into something that's clearly not working, just because they've already invested so much. It's the "throwing good money after bad" trap where we double down on bad decisions rather than admit we made a mistake.

# 2. Recognizing the Bias

## 2.1. Key Signs to Watch For

üîÅ **"We've Come This Far" Thinking**: You hear yourself saying "We can't stop now" or "We've invested too much to quit."

**Ignoring New Evidence**: You dismiss or downplay information that shows your decision was wrong.

**Sunk Cost Focus**: You justify continued investment by emphasizing what you've already spent rather than future prospects.

Ô∏è **Defensive Posture**: You become defensive when someone questions the wisdom of continuing your current path.

 **Throwing Good Money After Bad**: You commit additional resources to fix problems caused by your initial investment.

**Personal Ego Investment**: Your identity becomes tied to the success of the decision, making it hard to admit failure.

# 3. How It Shows Up

## 3.1. Workplace Examples

- **Failing Project Syndrome**: A project is months behind schedule and over budget, but management keeps funding it because "we've already invested millions"
- **Bad Hiring Decisions**: Keeping an underperforming employee because of the extensive time and money spent on recruiting and training them
- **Outdated Technology**: Continuing to maintain legacy systems because of the initial investment, even though newer solutions would be more cost-effective
- **Marketing Campaign Failures**: Pouring more money into an advertising campaign that isn't generating results because "we've already committed to this strategy"

## 3.2. Daily Life Scenarios

- **Home Repair Money Pit**: Your car keeps breaking down, but you keep paying for expensive repairs instead of buying a more reliable vehicle
- **Relationship Persistence**: Staying in an unhappy relationship because of the time and emotional energy you've already invested
- **Hobby Obsession**: Continuing to invest in expensive equipment for a hobby you no longer enjoy because of the initial investment
- **Education Commitment**: Persisting with a degree program you hate because you've already completed two years of study

## 3.3. Financial Decision-Making üí∞

- **Stock Market Trap**: Continuing to invest in a failing stock because you've already lost so much money, hoping it will "bounce back"
- **Real Estate Money Pit**: Keeping a property that's costing more than it's worth because of the initial purchase price and renovation costs
- **Business Investment**: Pouring more money into a failing business because of the startup costs and personal savings invested
- **Retirement Planning**: Sticking with an underperforming financial advisor because of the long-term relationship and fees already paid

# 4. Quick Test

## 4.1. Self-Assessment Questions

1. **The Sunk Cost Test**: Would you continue this investment if you hadn't already spent anything on it? If the answer is no, you're likely escalating commitment.
2. **The Fresh Perspective Test**: If a friend came to you with this exact situation (knowing what you know but having no emotional investment), what would you advise them to do?
3. **The Future Focus Test**: Are you making decisions based on future potential or past investments? Be honest about which one is driving your choices.
4. **The Evidence Test**: What new information would make you stop this investment? If you can't think of anything, you might be too committed.
5. **The 24-Hour Rule**: If you were forced to stop this investment for 24 hours and then reconsider with fresh eyes, what would you decide?

**Scoring**: If you find yourself making excuses or feeling defensive about these questions, you're likely experiencing escalation of commitment.

**Key Insight**: The resources you've already spent are gone forever‚Äîthe only question that matters is whether investing additional resources represents the best use of your future time, money, and energy. Sometimes the bravest and smartest decision is to stop.
