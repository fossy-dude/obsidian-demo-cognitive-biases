# 1. ELI5

Unit bias is when we think whatever amount we're given is the "right" amount to use or eat. If someone gives you a big plate of food, you'll probably eat it all because your brain thinks "this is one serving, so I should finish it" - even if you're already full!

# 2. Recognizing the Bias

Look for these warning signs that unit bias is affecting your decisions:

- üçΩÔ∏è **Finishing everything on your plate** even when you're no longer hungry
- üì¶ **Using entire packages** of products without considering if you need that much
- üíä **Taking full doses** of medication when less might work just as well
- üõí **Buying bulk sizes** because they seem like "one unit" even if it's too much
- **Following default settings** without questioning if they're appropriate for you
- **Completing entire tasks** in one sitting when breaking them up would be more efficient
- **Refilling containers** to the top because "that's how they should be"

# 3. How Bias Shows Up

## 3.1. Workplace Scenarios

- **Meeting lengths**: Automatically scheduling 60-minute meetings because that's the calendar default, even when 30 minutes would suffice
- **Task completion**: Working through entire project phases without breaks because they're presented as "one unit"
- **Resource usage**: Using entire budget allocations because "that's what we were given"
- **Email responses**: Feeling compelled to answer every point in an email rather than focusing on what's important

## 3.2. Daily Life Examples

- **Food portions**: Eating entire restaurant servings or pre-packaged meals regardless of actual hunger
- **Product usage**: Using a full cap of laundry detergent when half would work just as well
- **Time blocks**: Treating TV episodes, movie lengths, or social media sessions as indivisible units
- **Shopping habits**: Buying multi-packs or family sizes because they seem like "one purchase" decision

## 3.3. Financial Impact

- **Package deals**: Purchasing bundles because they're presented as "one unit" even when you don't need all components
- **Subscription tiers**: Choosing higher-priced plans because they seem like "one complete package"
- **Bulk purchases**: Buying large quantities to "get the deal" even if it leads to waste
- **Investment rounds**: Investing fixed amounts because they're presented as standard units

# 4. Quick Test or Checklist

Ask yourself these questions to check for unit bias:

1. **"Am I doing this because it's the default or standard amount?"**
   - If you removed the container/packaging/context, would you still choose this amount?

2. **"Have I assessed my actual needs vs. the provided unit?"**
   - Are you hungry, or just eating because it's there?
   - Do you need this much product, or are you following the package?

3. **"Can I break this down into smaller, more appropriate units?"**
   - Could you save half for later?
   - Could you use half the recommended amount?
   - Could you accomplish this in smaller time blocks?

4. **"Would I choose this amount if I had to measure it myself?"**
   - If you had to portion this out manually, would it be the same?

# 5. How to Counteract

## 5.1. Immediate Strategies

- üìè **Repackage immediately**: When you get home, divide large packages into smaller, appropriate portions
- ‚è∞ **Set personal limits**: Decide your own portion sizes before encountering pre-packaged units
- **Question defaults**: Always ask "is this the right amount for me?" when facing standard units
- ü•´ **Use smaller containers**: Serve food on smaller plates, use smaller cups, store in smaller containers

## 5.2. Mindset Shifts

- **Think in percentages**: Instead of "finishing," think "I'll eat 70% of this"
- ‚öñÔ∏è **Balance scales**: Consider the unit size relative to your actual needs, not just what's provided
- **Normalize incompleteness**: Get comfortable leaving things unfinished when appropriate
- **Track actual consumption**: Keep a log for a week to see how much you actually need vs. consume

## 5.3. Environmental Changes

- üõí **Shop differently**: Buy individual items instead of multi-packs when possible
- üçΩÔ∏è **Pre-portion meals**: Plate food in the kitchen rather than eating from family-style containers
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Use timers**: Set alarms to break up automatic unit completion (like TV watching or work sessions)
- üìù **Create personal standards**: Develop your own serving sizes and stick to them regardless of packaging

## 5.4. Practical Examples

- **Restaurant meals**: Ask for a to-go box immediately and put half away before starting
- **Medication**: Start with half doses when appropriate and safe
- **Cleaning products**: Use measuring tools instead of pouring directly from large containers
- **Time management**: Break work into 25-minute focused sessions rather than working until tasks feel "complete"
