# 1. ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5)

Imagine you have a box of crayons, and you think all the red crayons are good at drawing fire and all the blue crayons are good at drawing water. But what if a red crayon is actually amazing at drawing oceans? That's what stereotype bias is - when we think everyone in a group is the same, just because of which group they're in!

Think about it like this: if you meet one dog that's friendly and wags its tail, you might think ALL dogs are friendly. But some dogs might be shy or scared. Stereotype bias is when we put people in boxes in our minds and forget that each person is special and different, just like every crayon can draw many different things!

# 2. Recognizing the Bias

**Warning Signs to Watch For:**
- üì¶ You automatically categorize people based on their appearance, background, or group membership
- üè∑Ô∏è You use phrases like "all [group] are..." or "[group] always..."
- You make assumptions about someone's abilities, preferences, or characteristics before getting to know them
- Your memories about people from certain groups tend to confirm your existing beliefs
- You interpret new information to fit your existing stereotypes about groups
- üôà You ignore or dismiss evidence that contradicts your stereotypes
- You overgeneralize from limited experiences with members of a group

**Common Stereotype Categories:**
- **Gender stereotypes**: Assumptions about what men/women "should" be like or do
- **Racial/ethnic stereotypes**: Beliefs about capabilities or behaviors based on race or ethnicity
- **Age stereotypes**: Assumptions about abilities or preferences based on age
- **Occupational stereotypes**: Beliefs about what people in certain jobs are like
- **Cultural/national stereotypes**: Generalizations about people from certain countries or cultures
- **Socioeconomic stereotypes**: Assumptions based on someone's economic background

**Cognitive Red Flags:**
- "People from [country] are all..."
- "Men naturally excel at..."
- "Women are better at..."
- "Older people can't..."
- "Young people always..."
- "People in that profession are typically..."
- "You'd never expect someone from [background] to..."

# 3. How It Shows Up

## 3.1. **Workplace Examples**

**Hiring and Promotion Decisions:**
- **Gender Role Assignment**: A manager automatically assumes a female candidate would be better at "people-oriented" tasks while assuming a male candidate would be better at technical work, regardless of actual skills
- **Age-Based Capability Assumptions**: Hiring managers pass on older candidates assuming they won't adapt to new technology, while assuming younger candidates lack necessary experience

## 4.3. **Stereotype Awareness Scale**

**Score yourself based on the checklists above:**
- **0-5 points**: Low stereotype bias - you consistently see people as individuals
- **6-15 points**: Moderate stereotype bias - you sometimes rely on stereotypes but can overcome them
- **16-25 points**: High stereotype bias - stereotypes significantly influence your perceptions and decisions

**Reality Check Questions:**
1. "When I meet someone new, what are the first three things I notice about them?"
2. "How often do I find myself surprised by people who don't fit my expectations?"
3. "What assumptions do I make about people based on their appearance or background?"
4. "Can I recall times when my stereotypes about someone were completely wrong?"
5. "Do I treat people differently based on what group I perceive them to be in?"

**The Individuality Test**: Think about three people you know well who share a demographic characteristic. List ways they're different from each other and from stereotypes about their group.

**Remember**: Stereotypes are a normal part of human cognition - our brains naturally categorize information to make sense of the world. The goal isn't to eliminate categorization entirely, but to remain aware of our stereotypes and actively work to see people as complex individuals rather than group representatives.

**Key Insight**: The most powerful antidote to stereotypes is genuine human connection. When we take the time to know people as individuals, we discover that the rich diversity within any group far outweighs the simplified characteristics our minds assign to them. Every person you meet has a unique story, perspective, and set of experiences that no stereotype could ever capture.
