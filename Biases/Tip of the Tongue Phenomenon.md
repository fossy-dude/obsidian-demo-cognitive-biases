# 1. ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5)

Imagine you're trying to remember the name of your favorite cartoon character. You know it starts with "M" and has something to do with mice, but you just can't say the name! It's right there, like it's sitting on the tip of your tongue, but it won't come out. üëÖ

The Tip of the Tongue phenomenon is when your brain knows a word or name exists and can almost remember it, but the exact word won't come to mind. It's like having the answer locked in a room but you can't find the key!

# 2. Recognizing the Bias

## 2.1. Key Signs to Watch For

**Partial Recall**: You can remember details about the word (first letter, number of syllables, similar words) but not the word itself.

**Frustration Buildup**: You feel increasing frustration because you know you know the answer, but it won't come to mind.

**Contextual Memory**: You remember when and where you learned the information, or who told you, but not the specific term.

 **Phonological Cues**: You find yourself making sounds similar to the word, or feeling like you're about to say it.

 **Blocking Sensation**: You experience a mental "block" where other related words come to mind but not the one you want.

# 3. How It Shows Up

## 3.1. Workplace Examples

- **Technical Terms**: During a presentation, you need to mention a specific software feature but can only remember it starts with "auto" and has something to do with formatting
- **Client Names**: You're about to introduce a colleague to an important client but suddenly can't remember the client's last name, even though you've met them multiple times
- **Industry Acronyms**: In a team meeting, you're discussing a project and forget the specific acronym for the development methodology you're using
- **Procedure Names**: When training a new employee, you need to explain a process but can't recall the exact name of the methodology
- **Product Features**: During a sales call, you struggle to remember the specific name of a key product feature you're trying to sell

## 3.2. Daily Life Scenarios

- **Actor Names**: You're watching a movie and recognize an actor but can't remember their name, even though you've seen them in many films
- **Song Titles**: A song is stuck in your head and you know all the lyrics, but you can't remember the title or who sings it
- **Book Titles**: You're recommending a book to a friend and can describe the plot perfectly but can't recall the title
- **Restaurant Names**: You're trying to tell someone about a great restaurant you visited but can't remember its name, even though you remember the location and what you ate
- **Friend's Partner Name**: You run into a friend and want to ask about their partner but can't remember their partner's name

## 3.3. Financial Decision-Making üí∞

- **Investment Terms**: You're discussing retirement planning with a financial advisor but can't recall the specific name of the investment vehicle you want to ask about
- **Banking Products**: You're at the bank trying to access a specific account type but can't remember its exact name
- **Tax Terminology**: While doing your taxes, you know there's a specific deduction you qualify for but can't remember its technical name
- **Insurance Terms**: During a policy review, you want to ask about a specific coverage type but can't recall the exact term
- **Financial Concepts**: In a money management discussion, you understand a concept completely but can't remember its proper financial terminology

# 4. Quick Test

## 4.1. Self-Assessment Questions

1. **The Partial Memory Test**: How often do you find yourself saying "I know what it is, I just can't remember the name"?
2. **The Frustration Level**: When you can't recall a word, do you feel confident that you know it but just can't access it right now?
3. **The Detail Recall**: Can you usually remember details about the elusive word (like its first letter, meaning, or context) even when you can't remember the word itself?
4. **The Resolution Pattern**: How often does the word eventually come to you later, either when you're not thinking about it or when someone provides a small hint?
5. **The Frequency Factor**: Does this happen more often with words you don't use frequently, or can it happen with common words too?

**Scoring**: If you answered "often" or "very often" to more than two questions, you regularly experience the Tip of the Tongue phenomenon.

## 4.2. Situational Awareness

- Public speaking or presentations
- Important meetings or interviews
