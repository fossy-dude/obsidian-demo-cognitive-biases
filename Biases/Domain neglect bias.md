# 1. ELI5

Domain Neglect Bias is when people forget to use their specialized knowledge when solving problems that mix different subjects. It's like being a great chef who only knows how to cook with expensive ingredients, but when asked to make a simple meal with basic items, you completely forget all your cooking skills because you're focused on the wrong tools.

# 2. Recognizing the Bias

- You're treating a complex problem as if it only requires knowledge from one field
- You notice experts from one domain making basic mistakes in another area they should understand
- You're applying the same solution framework to every problem, regardless of context
- You hear yourself or others saying "That's not my area of expertise" when asked basic questions
- You're overlooking obvious solutions because they come from outside your primary field
- You notice team members talking past each other using different domain-specific language

# 3. How Bias Shows Up

**Workplace Examples:**
- A software engineer who designs a beautiful app but forgets basic marketing principles that would make it successful
- A financial analyst who creates complex models but ignores simple psychological factors that affect market behavior
- HR professionals who implement perfect hiring processes legally but fail to consider basic human psychology in candidate selection

**Daily Life Examples:**
- A doctor who gives perfect medical advice but forgets to consider if their patient can afford the treatment
- An academic who writes brilliant research papers but can't explain their work to regular people
- A nutritionist who creates perfect diet plans that don't account for people's actual cooking skills and time constraints

**Financial Examples:**
- Investors who analyze companies perfectly financially but ignore basic industry knowledge that would show the business model is flawed
- Accountants who create perfect tax strategies but don't understand the business well enough to know if those strategies actually make sense
- Bankers who use sophisticated financial models but forget basic common sense about whether a loan makes practical sense

**Decision Making Examples:**
- Policy makers who create well-intentioned laws but don't understand how they'll actually work in practice
- Engineers who build technically perfect solutions that nobody wants to use
- Project managers who follow methodologies perfectly but lose sight of the actual project goals

# 4. Quick Test or Checklist

**Self-Check Questions:**
- Have I consulted experts outside my primary field on this decision?
- Am I applying domain-specific solutions to cross-domain problems?
- Would someone from a different field look at my approach and think I'm missing something obvious?
- Have I considered the practical, real-world implications beyond my area of expertise?
- Am I using jargon that prevents me from seeing the bigger picture?
- Would my solution work if applied to a completely different context?

**Warning Signs:**
- [ ] I'm only considering solutions from my field of expertise
- [ ] I'm dismissing input from other disciplines as "not relevant"
- [ ] I'm using complex solutions when simple ones from other fields would work
- [ ] I'm not asking "What would someone in X field think about this?"

# 5. How to Counteract

** Cross-Domain Thinking:**
- **Consult multiple experts** from different fields before making important decisions
- **Ask "How would X profession approach this?"** forcing you to step outside your domain
- **Create interdisciplinary teams** that bring together different perspectives and knowledge bases
- **Use analogies** from other fields to help bridge understanding between domains

**ðŸ“š Knowledge Integration:**
- **Study adjacent fields** to your area of expertise to build bridges between domains
- **Practice explaining your work** to people outside your field to identify assumptions
- **Keep a "domain translation" journal** noting how different fields approach similar problems
- **Attend conferences or workshops** outside your primary field to gain new perspectives

**ðŸ¤” Decision Making Strategies:**
- **Force yourself to list three different approaches** from three different fields before deciding
- **Role-play different perspectives** - "If I were a designer/engineer/psychologist, what would I do?"
- **Use checklists** that include domain-specific questions from multiple fields
- **Schedule regular "domain boundary reviews"** to ensure you're not missing cross-domain insights
