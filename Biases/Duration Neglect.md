# 1. ELI5

Imagine you have to sit through a really boring movie. Even if it's 3 hours long, you'll mostly remember the most boring parts and how you felt at the end, not that it was 3 hours. Your brain focuses on the worst moments and the final feeling, not how long the whole thing lasted.

# 2. Recognizing the Bias

- **Focusing only on peak moments** - remembering only the best/worst parts, not the full duration
- **Forgetting time context** - recalling experiences without considering how long they actually took
- **Judging by endings** - letting the final moments color your entire memory of an experience
- **Overweighting intensity** - giving too much importance to emotional highs and lows
- **Memory compression** - remembering events as shorter or longer than they actually were

# 3. How It Shows Up

**Daily Life Examples:**
- A 20-minute painful dental procedure feels worse in memory than a 2-hour mildly uncomfortable experience
- You remember a vacation by the highlight reel, not the 14 days of ordinary moments
- A terrible first date makes you forget the 2 pleasant hours before it
- You judge an entire restaurant experience by the burnt dessert at the end

**Workplace Scenarios:**
- Employees remember a project by the stressful final week, not the successful 6-month execution
- A 30-minute intense conflict overshadows 8 hours of productive collaboration
- Performance reviews focus on recent failures rather than sustained success over months
- Team members remember meetings by the heated arguments, not the hours of productive discussion

**Financial Decisions:**
- Investors judge stock performance by the recent crash, not years of steady growth
- A single bad investment decision overshadows years of smart financial planning
- You remember a shopping spree by the regrettable impulse buy, not the hours of careful budgeting
- Tax preparation is remembered for the stressful final hour, not the week of organized work

**Relationship Impact:**
- A relationship ending is remembered by the final fight, not years of happy moments
- You judge a friendship by a recent betrayal, ignoring years of loyalty
- A family gathering is remembered for one awkward conversation, not hours of connection
- A romantic evening is recalled based on the disappointing ending, not the perfect dinner

# 4. Quick Test

**Ask yourself these 3 questions:**

1. **When recalling an experience, do I only remember the best/worst moments and how it ended?**
   - Yes/No

2. **Am I judging the entire experience based on a small portion of time?**
   - Yes/No

3. **Can I accurately recall how long the experience actually lasted?**
   - Yes/No

**If you answered "Yes" to questions 1 or 2**, you're likely experiencing duration neglect. If you answered "No" to question 3, duration neglect is definitely affecting your memory.

# 5. How to Counteract

**Track Time Actively**
- Keep a time journal for important experiences
- Note duration alongside emotional intensity
- Use timers or apps to track actual time spent
- Review time logs before making decisions

**Practice Duration Awareness**
- Consciously consider the full timeline of experiences
- Ask "How long did this really take?" before judging
- Compare peak moments to overall duration
- Rate experiences on both intensity AND duration

ðŸ’¡ **Use Memory Aids**

- Take photos/videos throughout experiences, not just highlights
- Keep detailed notes about timing and duration
- Review complete records, not just emotional highlights
- Create balanced reviews that include both positive and negative moments

 **Reframe Your Perspective**
- Ask "What happened in the middle?" not just start and end
- Consider the "boring" or "normal" parts of experiences
- Calculate the ratio of good moments to total time
- Compare your memory to objective records

ðŸ“‹ **Decision Making Protocol**

- Create checklists that include duration considerations
- Ask others about their experience of time in shared situations
- Review complete data before making judgments
- Consider both the emotional journey AND the time investment
