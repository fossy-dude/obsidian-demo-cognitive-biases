# 1. ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5)

Imagine you're watching your favorite TV show, and right at the most exciting part, it says "TO BE CONTINUED..." You can't stop thinking about what will happen next! Your brain keeps playing with the unfinished story, trying to figure out the ending.

The Zeigarnik Effect is like that - our brains love to finish what we start! When we leave tasks unfinished, they bounce around in our minds like mental ping-pong balls, making it hard to focus on anything else until we complete them. That's why you can't stop thinking about that unanswered email or that half-done puzzle! üß©
