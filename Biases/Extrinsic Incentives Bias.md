# 1. ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5)

Imagine you think your friend only cleans their room because you promise to give them candy. But what if your friend actually just likes having a clean room and feels proud when it's tidy? üç¨‚ú® You're assuming they only care about the candy reward, but they might actually enjoy the activity itself!

Extrinsic incentives bias is when we think other people are mostly motivated by outside rewards like money, prizes, or treats, while we ourselves are motivated by things we actually enjoy or believe in‚Äîlike learning, helping others, or doing a good job.

# 2. Recognizing the Bias

## 2.1. Key Signs to Watch For

**"Just Pay Them More" Thinking**: You assume people will work harder or better if you just increase their pay or offer more bonuses.

**Motivation Misjudgment**: You believe others only do things for external rewards, while you do similar things for personal satisfaction.

üèÜ **Overemphasis on Extrinsic Rewards**: You design motivation systems focused primarily on external incentives rather than internal satisfaction.

 **Intrinsic Motivation Blindness**: You fail to see or acknowledge that others might genuinely enjoy their work or find it meaningful.

 **Self-Other Motivation Gap**: You explain your own behavior in terms of passion and interest, but others' behavior in terms of external pressure.

**Performance-Satisfaction Confusion**: You assume that people who aren't rewarded externally must be unhappy or unmotivated.

# 3. How It Shows Up

## 3.1. Workplace Examples

- **Employee Motivation Assumptions**: Managers assume employees only work hard for promotions and bonuses, while ignoring that many are motivated by mastery, purpose, or team collaboration
- **Compensation Strategy Overreliance**: Companies focus exclusively on salary and benefits to attract talent, neglecting to emphasize meaningful work, growth opportunities, or company culture
- **Performance Review Misalignment**: Leaders believe that financial incentives are the primary driver of performance, overlooking the importance of recognition, autonomy, and personal development
- **Team Building Missteps**: Organizations rely on expensive incentives and competitions to boost teamwork, failing to foster genuine camaraderie and shared purpose

## 3.2. Daily Life Scenarios

- **Parenting Reward Dependency**: Parents assume children will only behave well if promised toys or treats, rather than helping them understand the intrinsic value of good behavior
- **Volunteer Motivation Misunderstanding**: People assume volunteers only participate in charity work for resume building or social recognition, not seeing genuine altruistic motivation
- **Hobby Interest Misjudgment**: When someone pursues a hobby passionately, others assume they're trying to make money or gain status, not recognizing genuine enjoyment
- **Educational Motivation Errors**: Teachers assume students only learn for grades, failing to recognize and nurture natural curiosity and love of learning

## 3.3. Financial Decision-Making üí∞

- **Investment Advisor Misunderstanding**: Clients assume financial advisors are only motivated by commissions, not seeing genuine desire to help clients achieve their goals
- **Business Partnership Assumptions**: Entrepreneurs assume potential partners are only interested in financial returns, overlooking shared vision and passion for the business
- **Consumer Behavior Misinterpretation**: Marketers believe customers only buy products based on price and discounts, underestimating brand loyalty and product satisfaction
- **Salary Negotiation Blind Spots**: Job candidates assume employers are only motivated by minimizing costs, not seeing the employer's genuine desire to attract and retain quality talent

# 4. Quick Test

## 4.1. Self-Assessment Questions

1. **The Self-Other Comparison Test**: Think about an activity you enjoy (like cooking, exercising, or working on a project). Why do YOU do it? Now think about someone else doing the same activity‚Äîwhat's your first assumption about why THEY do it? If there's a gap, you may have this bias.

2. **The Motivation Inventory**: List 5 things you do regularly and why you do them. Now list 5 things others do and why you think they do them. Are you more likely to attribute your own actions to internal motivation and others' to external rewards?

3. **The "No Money" Scenario**: If you removed all external rewards (money, recognition, prizes) from a situation, would you assume people would stop participating? If yes, ask yourself whether YOU would stop doing similar activities without external rewards.

4. **The Workplace Assessment**: At work, what percentage of employee motivation do you attribute to extrinsic factors versus intrinsic factors? Now ask yourself what percentage motivates YOU personally. Is there a significant difference?

5. **The Child Behavior Test**: When you see a child doing something well (like sharing or studying), what's your first assumption about why they're doing it? If you immediately think about rewards they might receive, you may be underestimating intrinsic motivation.

**Scoring**: If you consistently attribute others' behavior to external rewards while explaining your own behavior through internal motivation, you're likely experiencing extrinsic incentives bias.

**Remember**: Extrinsic incentives bias is particularly problematic because it can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. When we assume others are only motivated by external rewards, we create systems that primarily offer external rewards, which can actually undermine existing intrinsic motivation over time.

**Key Insight**: The most effective motivation strategies recognize that humans are complex beings motivated by a rich combination of internal satisfaction, purpose, growth, connection, AND external rewards. The art of motivating others lies in understanding and honoring this complexity rather than reducing human motivation to simple carrots and sticks.
