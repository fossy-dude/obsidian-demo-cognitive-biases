# 1. ELI5

Your brain pays way more attention to bad things than good thingsâ€”like how one mean comment can ruin your whole day even if you got ten compliments. This happens because our ancestors needed to quickly spot dangers (like scary animals) to survive, so our brains evolved to notice negative stuff first. It's like having a mental alarm system that's way too sensitive and keeps going off for small problems!

# 2. Recognizing the Bias

**Warning Signs You're Caught in Negativity Bias:**

- **Scrolling doom loops** - Endlessly consuming bad news or negative social media content
- **Fixation on criticism** - One negative review overshadows dozens of positive ones
- **Worst-case scenario thinking** - Automatically jumping to catastrophic outcomes
- **Selective memory** - Easily recalling failures but struggling to remember successes
- **Disproportionate emotional reactions** - Minor setbacks feel like major disasters
- **Negative filter conversations** - Focusing only on problems when someone shares mixed news
- **Risk paralysis** - Avoiding opportunities because you overestimate potential downsides
- **Defensive posture** - Expecting attacks or criticism in neutral situations

# 3. How Bias Shows Up

## 3.1. ðŸ“º **News Media & Information Consumption**

- **Breaking news addiction**: Bad news gets 5x more clicks than positive stories
- **Social media algorithms**: Platforms amplify outrage and controversy for engagement
- **Economic reporting**: Market crashes get front-page coverage; steady growth doesn't
- **Weather obsession**: People remember the "storm of the century" but forget beautiful days

## 3.2. **Workplace Dynamics**

- **Performance reviews**: Managers spend 80% of time discussing areas for improvement vs. strengths
- **Meeting focus**: Problems dominate agendas while successes get brief mentions
- **Project retrospectives**: Teams deeply analyze failures but quickly gloss over wins
- **Feedback culture**: Constructive criticism feels more "important" than recognition

## 3.3. ðŸ’• **Relationships & Social Life**

- **Argument amplification**: One fight feels more significant than weeks of harmony
- **First impressions**: One awkward moment overshadows multiple positive interactions
- **Parenting anxiety**: Focusing on what could go wrong rather than celebrating milestones
- **Friend group dynamics**: Gossip and complaints dominate conversations over good news

## 3.4. ðŸ›’ **Consumer Behavior**

- **Online reviews**: People write negative reviews 4x more often than positive ones

## 5.2. ðŸ“± **Daily Habits (5-15 minutes)**

**Media Audit**: Track your information consumption for a week
