# 1. ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5)

Imagine you're playing a game where you have to remember everyone's name before it's your turn. When it's almost your turn, you get so nervous about what you're going to say that you completely forget the names you just heard!

The next-in-line effect is like when your brain gets too busy worrying about what you're about to do, so it doesn't pay attention to what's happening right before. It's like your brain is too busy rehearsing your lines to listen to the person speaking right before you!

# 2. Recognizing the Bias

**Warning Signs You're Experiencing the Next-in-Line Effect:**

- **Pre-performance anxiety** - Feeling nervous or distracted right before you need to speak or perform
- **Memory gaps for recent information** - Struggling to recall things that were just said or shown
- **Rehearsal focus** - Mentally practicing what you're going to say instead of listening to others
- **Timing-specific forgetfulness** - Poor memory for information received immediately before your turn
- **Presentation tunnel vision** - Focusing so much on your upcoming performance that you miss current context
- **Question confusion** - Not remembering the question you were just asked before answering

 **Internal Thoughts That Signal This Bias:**

- "What am I going to say?" (repeating this instead of listening)
- "I hope I don't mess this up..."
- "Let me practice my response one more time"
- "I should have paid more attention to what they just said"
- "What was the question again?"

# 3. How Bias Shows Up

## 3.1. **Workplace Scenarios**

- **Meeting contributions**: "I completely missed the last point before my turn to speak" (focusing on your own talking points instead of listening)
- **Presentation Q&A**: "I don't remember the question you just asked" (mentally rehearsing your answer instead of listening)
- **Team introductions**: "I forgot the name of the person who spoke right before me" (nervous about your own introduction)
- **Project updates**: "I missed the deadline they just mentioned" (worrying about your update instead of listening)
- **Job interviews**: "I didn't catch the interviewer's last question" (rehearsing answers in your head)

## 3.2. **Daily Life Examples**

- **Classroom participation**: "I don't remember what the teacher just asked" (worrying about giving the right answer)
- **Social conversations**: "What did you just say?" (thinking about what you want to add to the conversation)
- **Family meetings**: "I missed the plan they just discussed" (anxious about your turn to share news)
- **Group activities**: "I don't know the rules they just explained" (nervous about participating)
- **Phone calls**: "Could you repeat that?" (distracted by thinking about what you need to say)

## 3.3. **Performance Situations**

- **Public speaking**: "I forgot the setup for my speech" (mentally rehearsing instead of listening to introductions)
- **Musical performances**: "I missed the cue right before my solo" (focused on your part instead of the group)
- **Sports activities**: "I didn't hear the coach's last instruction" (thinking about your role in the play)
- **Acting and theater**: "I forgot my entrance cue" (nervous about your lines)
- **Dance performances**: "I missed the tempo change" (focused on your steps instead of the music)

## 3.4. üìö **Learning And Education**

- **Classroom discussions**: "I don't remember the point the previous student made" (preparing your own contribution)
- **Study groups**: "What was the concept we just covered?" (thinking about the topic you need to explain)
- **Workshops and seminars**: "I missed the key point before my breakout session" (anxious about your participation)
- **Language classes**: "I don't remember the phrase they just taught" (worried about speaking)
- **Training sessions**: "I forgot the step they just demonstrated" (mentally practicing your turn)

# 4. Quick Test or Checklist

** Check Your Next-in-Line Effect:**

1. **The Meeting Test**:
   - Think about your last team meeting or group discussion
   - Do you remember what the person right before you said?
   - If you frequently can't recall, you may experience this bias

2. **The Anxiety Check**:
   - Before speaking in groups, do you feel nervous or distracted?
   - Do you find yourself rehearsing what you'll say instead of listening?
   - This anxiety often triggers the next-in-line effect

3. **The Memory Gap Test**:
   - In group settings, do you often ask people to repeat what they just said?
   - Is this especially true when it's your turn to speak next?
   - These memory gaps suggest the bias is affecting you

4. **The Focus Assessment**:
   - When you know you'll need to speak soon, where is your attention?
   - Are you fully present with others, or mentally rehearsing?
   - Lack of present-moment attention indicates this bias

5. **The Pattern Recognition**:
   - Do you consistently struggle to remember information received right before you perform?
   - Does this happen across different situations (work, social, learning)?
   - A consistent pattern confirms you experience this effect

**Scoring Your Next-in-Line Effect:**

- **0-1 "yes" answers**: Low susceptibility - you maintain good attention before performing
- **2-3 "yes" answers**: Moderate susceptibility - you sometimes experience pre-performance distraction
- **4-5 "yes" answers**: High susceptibility - the next-in-line effect significantly impacts your memory and attention
