# 1. ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5)

Imagine you buy a toy that costs $10, but when you play with it, it's not fun at all. Your friend says, "Let's play with my cool new toy instead!" But you think, "I already spent $10 on this toy, so I have to keep playing with it, even though it's not fun."

That's the sunk cost fallacy! It's when you keep doing something just because you already spent time, money, or effort on it, even when it would be better to stop and try something else.

# 2. Recognizing the Bias

The sunk cost fallacy occurs when we make decisions based on past investments rather than future outcomes. We feel emotionally attached to our previous commitments and find it hard to "cut our losses" even when continuing clearly isn't in our best interest.

**Key signs you're falling for this bias:**
- ðŸ¤” "I've already put so much into this, I can't quit now"
- "It would be a waste if I stopped after all this effort"
- ðŸ˜Ÿ Feeling guilty about abandoning something you've invested in
- Making decisions based on what you've already spent rather than what's best moving forward

# 3. How It Shows Up

## 3.1. Workplace Scenarios

- **Projects**: Continuing a failing project because "we've already spent 6 months on it"
- **Training**: Sticking with ineffective training programs because the company paid for them
- **Software**: Using outdated software systems because of the initial investment, even though newer options would save time and money
- **Hiring**: Keeping underperforming employees because of the time and resources spent on their training

## 3.2. Daily Life

- **Books**: Finishing a boring book because you're halfway through
- **Movies**: Watching a terrible movie to the end because you paid for the ticket
- **Relationships**: Staying in unfulfilling relationships because of the time invested
- **Hobbies**: Continuing expensive hobbies you no longer enjoy because of the equipment purchased

## 3.3. Financial Decisions

- **Investments**: Holding onto losing stocks because you've already lost money
- **Subscriptions**: Keeping unused subscriptions because you paid for the year
- **Car Repairs**: Spending more on repairs than the car is worth because you've already put money into it
- **Gym Memberships**: Continuing to pay for a gym you never visit because of the sign-up fee

# 4. Quick Test

**Ask yourself these questions:**
1. If I hadn't already invested time/money/effort, would I start this today?
2. Is my decision based on past costs or future benefits?
3. Am I continuing mainly to justify my previous investment?
4. What would I advise a friend to do in this exact situation?
5. If I stopped now, what would I gain by redirecting my resources elsewhere?

**Red flag responses:**
- "I've come too far to quit"
- "I don't want to waste what I've already spent"
- "It would all be for nothing if I stopped now"

# 5. How to Counteract

## 5.1. Mindset Shifts

- **Forward-focused thinking**: Base decisions on future outcomes, not past investments
- **Opportunity cost awareness**: Consider what you could gain by stopping and redirecting resources
- **Reframe "quitting"**: View stopping as strategic resource reallocation, not failure
- **Zero-based thinking**: Ask "If I were starting from scratch today, what would I do?"

## 5.2. ðŸ“‹ Practical Strategies

- **Set predetermined exit criteria**: Define in advance when you'll stop pursuing something
- **Regular reviews**: Schedule periodic assessments of whether continuing still makes sense
- **Seek outside perspectives**: Ask for unbiased opinions from people not emotionally invested
- **Calculate opportunity costs**: Quantify what you're missing by continuing with the current path

## 5.3. Action Steps

1. **Acknowledge the sunk cost**: Accept that past investments are gone and can't be recovered
2. **Evaluate current reality**: Assess the situation as it stands today, ignoring past investments
3. **Consider alternatives**: What else could you do with your time, money, and energy?
4. **Make a clean break**: If you decide to stop, do so decisively without looking back
5. **Learn and apply**: Use the experience to make better decisions about future investments

## 5.4. When to Stay vs. When to Go

**Stay if:**
- The fundamental situation has improved
- You're seeing meaningful progress toward your goals
- The remaining investment required is reasonable
- Future benefits outweigh future costs

**Go if:**
- You're only continuing to justify past investments
- The situation hasn't improved despite significant effort
- Better alternatives are available
- The emotional or financial cost of continuing is too high

Remember: Smart decisions sometimes mean knowing when to walk away, even when it feels like you're "wasting" what you've already invested. The real waste is throwing good resources after bad.
