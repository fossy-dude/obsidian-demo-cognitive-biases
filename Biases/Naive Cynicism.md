# 1. ELI5

Na√Øve cynicism is when you automatically assume that people are selfish and only care about themselves, even when they're actually being helpful or kind. It's like thinking every kid who shares their cookies is just trying to get something in return, when really some kids just like being nice. This bias makes us believe the worst in others instead of giving them the benefit of the doubt.

# 2. Recognizing the Bias

**Warning Signs in Your Thinking:**
- You immediately question someone's motives when they help you
- You assume "there must be a catch" when something seems too good
- You're surprised when people act selflessly or generously
- You tend to believe people only do nice things for personal gain
- You find yourself saying "I knew it!" when someone shows their "true selfish colors"
- You're skeptical of compliments, thinking they're manipulative

**Physical & Behavioral Indicators:**
- Eye-rolling when others express kindness or generosity
- Immediately looking for hidden agendas in positive situations
- Feeling suspicious about group activities or team efforts
- Difficulty accepting help without offering immediate repayment

# 3. How Bias Shows Up

## 3.1. **Workplace Scenarios**

- Assuming a colleague's offer to help with your project is just to take credit later
- Believing your boss only gives positive feedback to manipulate you into working harder
- Thinking team members who volunteer for extra tasks are just trying to get promoted
- Questioning the sincerity of company wellness programs, assuming they're just for PR

## 3.2. **Daily Life Examples**

- Suspecting your neighbor's friendly greeting is just because they want something
- Thinking friends who remember your birthday are only doing it so you'll remember theirs
- Assuming people who hold doors open or let you merge in traffic are just showing off
- Believing family members who offer help are secretly keeping score of favors

## 3.3. **Financial Decision Making**

- Assuming financial advisors only recommend products that give them the best commission
- Thinking stores with "good deals" are somehow tricking you with hidden costs
- Believing charities spend most donations on overhead rather than helping people

## 3.4. **Relationship Impact**

- Difficulty trusting romantic partners' genuine affection
- Questioning friends' loyalty during challenging times

# 4. Quick Test or Checklist

**Check yourself with these questions:**

ü§î **When someone helps you, do you automatically ask:**

- "What do they really want from me?"
- "What's the catch here?"
- "How will they use this against me later?"

**Reality Check:**
- Can you recall 3 instances where people helped you with no obvious benefit to themselves?
- How often do you help others without expecting anything in return?
- When was the last time you were genuinely surprised by someone's kindness?

‚öñÔ∏è **Balance Test:**

- Do you give others the same benefit of the doubt you'd want for yourself?
- Are you more likely to assume negative or positive motives in ambiguous situations?
- Would your close friends say you're generally trusting or suspicious of others?

# 5. How to Counteract

## 5.1. **Immediate Strategies**

- **Pause and Reflect**: When you catch yourself assuming negative motives, stop and ask "What evidence do I have for this thought?"
- **Seek Alternative Explanations**: Force yourself to come up with 3 possible positive reasons for someone's behavior

- **Look for Patterns**: Track how often your cynical assumptions prove wrong vs. right

## 5.2. **Long-term Practices**

- **Expand Your Circle**: Interact with diverse groups to see different expressions of generosity
- **Volunteer Experience**: Engage in community service to witness selflessness firsthand
- **Share Positive Stories**: Make a habit of sharing examples of people's good deeds

## 5.3. **Mindset Shifts**

- **Most People Are Basically Good**: Research shows humans are wired for cooperation and kindness
- **Self-Fulfilling Prophecies**: Your cynicism might actually create the negative outcomes you expect
- **Trust as a Gift**: Giving trust benefits both you and the other person, building stronger connections
- **Protective ‚â† Productive**: While some skepticism is healthy, excessive cynicism damages relationships and opportunities

## 5.4. üìã **Action Plan**
