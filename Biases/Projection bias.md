# 1. ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5)

Imagine you love ice cream so much that you think everyone else must love it just as much as you do, even if some people don't like ice cream at all! Projection bias is when we assume other people think, feel, and want the same things we do right now, just because we're feeling that way.

It's like looking through glasses that show you the world only through your own feelings - you forget that other people might be wearing completely different glasses that show them a different world!

# 2. Recognizing the Bias

Projection Bias Occurs when We Assume Our Current Preferences, Feelings, and Values Will Remain Constant in the Future, and that Others Share Them Too

**Warning Signs You're Projecting:**
- **"Everyone must think..."** - Assuming your opinions are universal
- **"They'll love this!"** - Projecting your preferences onto others
- **"I'll always feel this way..."** - Ignoring how your preferences might change
- **Decision confusion** - Making future plans based only on current feelings
- **Gift-giving fails** - Buying others things you want, not what they want
- **"How could anyone disagree?"** - Being shocked when others have different opinions
- **Overcommitment** - Saying yes to future activities based on current energy levels

# 3. How Bias Shows Up

## 3.1. **Workplace Impact**

- **Career planning** - Assuming you'll always love your current job or industry
- **Team building** - Planning social events you enjoy without considering others' preferences
- **Project commitments** - Agreeing to tight deadlines when you're currently motivated
- **Leadership style** - Leading based on your current needs, not your team's needs
- **Training programs** - Offering learning opportunities you find valuable but others might not

## 3.2. **Daily Life Examples**

- **Grocery shopping** - Buying foods you currently like, forgetting future preferences change
- **Social plans** - Making weekend plans based on your Friday energy levels
- **Exercise routines** - Overcommitting to intense workouts when you're feeling energetic
- **Home purchases** - Buying houses with features you currently love but might not need later
- **Hobby investments** - Spending money on interests you're passionate about right now

## 3.3. **Financial Decision Impact**

- **Investment choices** - Taking risks based on current confidence, ignoring future caution
- **Subscription services** - Signing up for services you'll use less as interests change
- **Large purchases** - Buying expensive items based on current excitement
- **Budget planning** - Assuming future spending habits will match current discipline
- **Insurance decisions** - Underestimating future risk needs based on current health

## 3.4. **Health & Lifestyle Effects**

- **Diet plans** - Choosing restrictive diets when you're highly motivated
- **Gym memberships** - Paying for expensive memberships based on January enthusiasm
- **Relationship expectations** - Assuming current attraction levels will last forever
- **Sleep schedules** - Planning early wake-ups based on current productivity
- **Alcohol consumption** - Drinking more now assuming future self can handle it

# 4. Quick Test or Checklist

**Self-Assessment Questions:**
1. Have you ever said "I'll never change my mind about..." and then did?
2. Do you find yourself surprised when others don't share your enthusiasm?
3. Have you made commitments for next week based on how you feel right now?
4. Do you buy gifts for others that you'd love to receive?

**The Projection Awareness Test:**
- Think about 3 things you loved 5 years ago - do you still love them all?
- Consider 3 commitments you made last month when feeling energetic - did you follow through?
- Ask a friend: "What's something you think I overestimate about others?"

**Future Self Check:**
- [ ] When making plans, ask: "How might I feel about this in 3 days/3 months/3 years?"
- [ ] Before buying gifts, ask: "What does this person actually enjoy, not what would I want?"
- [ ] Notice when you say "always" or "never" about preferences
- [ ] Check if you're assuming others share your current emotional state

# 5. How to Counteract ️

## 5.1. **Immediate Actions**

- **Future perspective** - Before making decisions, imagine your future self might feel differently
- **Ask others** - When planning for others, ask about their preferences instead of assuming
- **Emotional awareness** - Notice when you're in intense emotional states that might cloud judgment
- **Time buffers** - Add waiting periods for significant decisions to avoid hot-state thinking

## 5.2. **Mindset Shifts**

- **Accept change** - Recognize that preferences naturally evolve over time
- **Embrace diversity** - Understand that different people have different needs and wants
- **Practice empathy** - Try to imagine others' perspectives, not just project your own
- **Humility** - Accept that you can't always predict how you'll feel in the future

## 5.3. **Systematic Approaches**

- **Preference journaling** - Track how your interests and feelings change over time
- **Decision frameworks** - Use structured decision-making tools that account for variability
- **Feedback loops** - Regularly check in with others about their actual preferences
- **Scenario planning** - Consider multiple possible future states when making decisions

## 5.4. **Workplace Strategies**

- **Flexible planning** - Build adaptability into project timelines and resource allocation
- **Employee surveys** - Regularly ask team members about their actual needs and preferences
- **Diverse benefits** - Offer multiple options to accommodate different work styles
- **Leadership training** - Teach managers to recognize and avoid projection bias

## 5.5. **Daily Life Practice**

- **Mindful consumption** - Pause before purchases and consider if future you would want this
- **Social planning** - When making group plans, actively seek everyone's input
- **Relationship check-ins** - Regularly ask partners and friends about their changing needs
- **Hobby sampling** - Try new interests with low commitment before major investments

> **Remember**: Just because you feel strongly about something right now doesn't mean that feeling will last, and it certainly doesn't mean everyone else feels the same way. Projection bias reminds us that the most reliable predictor of future behavior is knowing that preferences change.
