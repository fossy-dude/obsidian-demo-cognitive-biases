# 1. ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5)

🏛️ Imagine you're playing a game with rules that aren't very fair. Some kids get to start closer to the finish line, while others have to run twice as far.

Even if you're one of the kids who has to run farther, you might start thinking "well, this is probably fair for some reason" or "the kids who start closer must deserve it somehow."

System justification is when we convince ourselves that the way things are right now is probably the best way, even when it's not fair to everyone. It's like looking at a crooked picture and saying "I think it's supposed to be like that!" 📐

## 1.1. Recognizing the Bias

️ **You might be experiencing this bias when:**

- You defend unfair systems because "that's just how things are"
- You rationalize inequality by blaming those who are disadvantaged
- You resist change even when current systems clearly don't work
- You believe people in power deserve their position regardless of how they got there
- You minimize evidence of systemic problems
- You feel uncomfortable when someone challenges established norms

**Key phrases that signal system justification:**
- "That's just the way it is"
- "If it wasn't necessary, we wouldn't do it"
- "People get what they deserve"
- "It works for most people"
- "You can't fight the system"
- "It's not perfect, but it's the best we have"

Remember: Just because something "is" doesn't mean it "ought to be." Every social system was created by people and can be changed by people! ✊
