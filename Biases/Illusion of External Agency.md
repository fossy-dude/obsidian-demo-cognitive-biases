# 1. ELI5

The illusion of external agency is when people believe that good things happen to them because of outside forces or luck, rather than their own abilities or efforts. It's like winning a game and thinking "I got lucky" instead of recognizing your skill and practice. This bias makes us give credit to everything except ourselves when we succeed.

# 2. Recognizing the Bias

- **External attribution**: Automatically crediting luck, fate, or others for your successes
- **Self-deprecation**: Downplaying your role in positive outcomes
- **Superstition**: Believing external rituals or objects cause good results
- **Luck-focused language**: Using phrases like "I was lucky" or "it was meant to be"
- **Success anxiety**: Feeling uncomfortable taking credit for achievements
- **Imposter feelings**: Worrying others will discover you're not responsible for your success

# 3. How Bias Shows Up

**Workplace**: After successfully leading a project to completion, a manager tells their team "we got lucky with the timing" instead of acknowledging their strategic planning and leadership skills that made the project successful.

**Daily Life**: Someone bakes a perfect cake following a new recipe and insists "the oven must be extra good today" rather than recognizing their careful attention to detail and cooking skills.

**Social Settings**: A person gives a great presentation and receives compliments, but responds with "oh, I just had good slides" instead of accepting that their preparation and delivery skills made it effective.

**Financial Decisions**: An investor makes a successful stock pick and attributes it to "market conditions" rather than their research and analysis, potentially missing opportunities to replicate their success through skill.

# 4. Quick Test or Checklist

**Do you experience the illusion of external agency?**

- When you succeed, do you immediately credit external factors rather than your own efforts?
- Do you feel uncomfortable accepting compliments or praise for your achievements?
- Do you use phrases like "I got lucky" or "it just happened" more often than "I worked hard" or "I made this happen"?
- When you achieve something difficult, do you focus on what helped you rather than what you did to help yourself?
- Do you worry that taking credit for success makes you arrogant or boastful?

# 5. How to Counteract

üìö **Success journaling**: Keep a daily record of your achievements and the specific actions you took to accomplish them

ü§î **Credit analysis**: After each success, list three factors and identify which were within your control versus external

**Evidence collection**: Document the process behind your wins to see the pattern of your efforts leading to results

üí¨ **Practice acceptance**: Learn to say "thank you" when complimented instead of deflecting praise

 **Attribution retraining**: Consciously practice saying "I chose to..." or "I worked on..." when describing successes

üìù **Skill mapping**: Identify and document the specific skills you've developed that contribute to your achievements

 **Immediate recognition**: Catch yourself in the moment of external attribution and consciously give yourself credit
