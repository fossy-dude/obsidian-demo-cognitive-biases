# 1. ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5)

Imagine you have two friends who always tell you the same stories. If you hear the same story from both of them, you might think "Wow, everyone knows this story, it must be true!" But really, it's just the same story being told by the same people over and over.

Common source bias is when we think lots of different people agree on something, but really they all got their information from the same original source - like friends sharing the same rumor!

# 2. Recognizing the Bias

Common Source Bias Occurs when We Mistakenly Believe that Multiple Independent Sources Support a Claim, when in Reality They All Originate from the Same Underlying Source or Share the Same Flawed Methodology

**Key Warning Signs You're Experiencing This Bias:**

**Information Consumption Patterns:**
- You see multiple articles citing the same study but treat them as independent confirmation
- You notice several experts making similar claims but they all reference the same original research
- You feel confident about a conclusion because "everyone agrees" without checking if they're all referencing the same source
- You find yourself saying "I read this in multiple places" without realizing they're all paraphrasing the same content

**Research & Analysis Issues:**
- In academic work, you combine results from multiple studies that share the same dataset or methodology
- You treat replication as independent confirmation when it's actually from the same research group
- You overlook methodological flaws because multiple sources report the same findings
- You assume consensus exists without examining the original evidence

**️ Critical Thinking Red Flags:**
- You trust information because it appears in multiple venues, not because you've verified the source
- You feel confident about claims because "experts agree" without checking if they're all citing each other
- You overlook contradictory evidence because you're focused on the apparent consensus
- You mistake repetition for verification

**📱 Digital Age Indicators:**
- You see the same news story shared across multiple social media platforms and assume widespread agreement
- You believe a viral meme or infographic because it appears in multiple feeds
- You think "everyone knows this" when it's really just the same content being reshared
- You trust online reviews without noticing they might all be influenced by the same source

# 4. Quick Test or Checklist

## 4.1. **Self-Assessment Questions**

**Core Bias Detection:**
1. When you see multiple sources making the same claim, do you automatically assume they're independent without checking their references?
2. Have you ever felt confident about information because "everyone says so" without tracing it back to the original source?
3. Do you share articles or information without verifying if they're based on the same underlying data or research?
4. When making decisions, do you rely on the number of sources rather than the quality and independence of those sources?
5. Have you ever cited multiple sources in an argument, only to realize they all referenced the same original study?

**Advanced Detection Scenarios:**
6. **The News Headline Test**: You see the same story in 5 different news outlets. Do you think "This must be important" without checking if they're all sourcing from the same wire service?
7. **The Academic Paper Chain**: You're writing a research paper and find 10 studies supporting your hypothesis. Do you include all 10 without checking if they share the same dataset or methodology?
8. **The Social Media Echo Chamber**: Multiple friends share the same viral post. Do you assume widespread agreement without noticing they're all resharing from the same origin?
9. **The Expert Consensus Check**: You hear several experts make similar claims on different podcasts. Do you trust the consensus without verifying if they're all citing each other?

**Scoring Your Common Source Bias:**

- **0-2 "yes" answers**: Low bias - You're generally good at checking source independence
- **3-5 "yes" answers**: Moderate bias - You sometimes mistake repetition for verification
- **6-9 "yes" answers**: High bias - You frequently trust information based on volume rather than source quality

## 4.2. **Source Verification Checklist**

**Before Trusting Information, Ask:**
- [ ] Can I trace this information back to the original source?
- [ ] Are the multiple sources I'm seeing truly independent, or do they reference each other?
- [ ] Is there a possibility of shared methodology or data collection?
- [ ] Am I seeing genuine consensus or just amplification of the same message?
- [ ] Could there be financial, political, or social incentives driving the repetition?

** Quick Reality Checks:**

**The Citation Chain Test**: Follow the citations backward. Do multiple sources eventually lead back to the same original study or report?

**The Independence Challenge**: Remove one source from your information set. Does your understanding or confidence significantly change?

**The Methodology Review**: Examine how the information was gathered. Are different sources using similar approaches that might share the same limitations?

**The Timeline Analysis**: Look at when the information appeared. Did multiple sources report it around the same time, suggesting they got it from the same place?

**The Cross-Reference Check**: Find sources that might disagree with the consensus. Do they have legitimate alternative viewpoints or data?

**Remember**: In today's interconnected world, information can spread like wildfire. The same story, study, or claim can appear in dozens of places within hours. Always look beyond the surface appearance of widespread agreement to understand the true foundation of the information you're consuming.
