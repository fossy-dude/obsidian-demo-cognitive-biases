# 1. ELI5

 Your body's feelings can trick your brain! When you're hungry, tired, or in pain, you might make bad decisions about totally unrelated things. Like getting angry at a friend when you're actually just hungry or tired - your body's signals are messing with your judgment!

# 2. Recognizing the Bias

Ô∏è **Warning Signs to Watch For:**

- Making impulsive decisions when hungry, tired, or in physical discomfort
- Experiencing strong emotions that seem disproportionate to the situation
- Blaming others for feelings that actually come from physical states
- Making rash judgments about people or situations when experiencing bodily discomfort
- Feeling unusually negative or pessimistic when physically unwell
- Having difficulty thinking clearly when experiencing physical symptoms
- Acting out of character when experiencing bodily sensations

# 3. How Bias Shows Up

**Workplace Examples:**
- Rejecting a great job offer because you had a headache during the interview
- Making harsh performance reviews when you're sleep-deprived
- Turning down a promotion opportunity because you're feeling anxious about physical symptoms
- Making impulsive career decisions when experiencing chronic pain

**Daily Life Examples:**
- Starting arguments with family when you're actually just hungry ("hangry")
- Canceling social plans because you're tired but blaming it on "not feeling like it"
- Making impulsive purchases when feeling physically uncomfortable
- Overreacting to minor issues when experiencing pain or discomfort

**Financial Examples:**
- Panic-selling investments when experiencing physical anxiety symptoms
- Making risky financial decisions when under the influence of caffeine or medication
- Avoiding necessary financial planning when feeling physically unwell
- Making impulsive spending decisions when experiencing physical discomfort

**Health & Relationships:**
- Misinterpreting partner's actions because you're actually feeling unwell
- Avoiding medical care because you're scared of the symptoms
- Blaming relationship problems on your partner when you're actually just tired or sick

# 4. Quick Test or Checklist

 **Self-Check Questions:**

- **Physical State Check:** "When did I last eat, sleep well, or take medication?"
- **Emotion-Body Connection:** "Could my current feelings actually be physical discomfort?"
- **Decision Timing:** "Am I making this decision while experiencing physical symptoms?"
- **Delay Test:** "Would I make the same choice if I felt physically better?"
- **External Factors:** "Have I considered how my body's state might be affecting my judgment?"

# 5. How to Counteract

Ô∏è **Practical Strategies:**

1. **Physical Self-Awareness:** Regularly check in with your body - hunger, thirst, fatigue, pain levels
2. **Decision Pause:** Wait until you're in a neutral physical state before making important decisions
3. **Basic Needs First:** Address physical needs (eat, sleep, hydration) before addressing emotional or complex issues
4. **Body-State Journaling:** Track how your physical state affects your mood and decisions
5. **Delay Major Decisions:** Postpone important choices when experiencing significant physical discomfort
6. **Seek Outside Perspective:** Ask trusted others for input when you're not feeling your best physically
7. **Create Decision Protocols:** Establish clear guidelines for decisions that account for physical state variations

üí° **Remember:** Your body and mind are connected! Physical comfort significantly impacts mental clarity and judgment.
