Also called `Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon`

# 1. ELI5

Have you ever learned a new word and then suddenly started hearing it everywhere? Or bought a red car and now notice red cars on every street? That's the Frequency Illusion—once your brain notices something new, it starts spotting it everywhere, making you think it's become more common when really you're just paying attention to it for the first time.

# 2. Recognizing the Bias

**Warning Signs You're Experiencing Frequency Illusion:**

- **Recent exposure + sudden abundance**: You notice something everywhere right after learning about it
- **"Where did this come from?"** thoughts: Wondering if something is suddenly trending or becoming popular
- **Timing seems suspicious**: The frequency spike happens immediately after your first exposure
- **Others don't notice the increase**: Friends and family don't see the same pattern you're experiencing
- **No logical reason for increase**: There's no clear explanation why this thing would actually become more common

# 3. How Bias Shows Up

🛒 **Shopping & Purchasing Decisions**

- After researching a specific brand, you suddenly see their ads and products everywhere
- Looking at apartments in a neighborhood makes you notice "For Rent" signs you never saw before
- Considering a new phone model leads to spotting that exact phone in everyone's hands

📚 **Learning New Information**

- Learning a historical fact makes it appear in multiple conversations and articles that week
- Hearing a new phrase from a friend leads to encountering it in books, podcasts, and social media
- Discovering a new concept at work suddenly makes it relevant to every project

💻 **Technology & Trends**

- First hearing about a startup makes news articles about them seem to multiply overnight
- Trying a new app leads to seeing it mentioned in multiple reviews and recommendations
- Learning about a programming language makes job postings requiring it appear everywhere

🏥 **Health & Symptoms**

- Researching a medical condition makes you notice symptoms you might have ignored before
- Learning about a disease from news coverage makes you hyper-aware of related health information
- Hearing about a side effect makes you more likely to experience or notice it

# 4. Quick Test or Checklist

**Ask Yourself These 3 Questions:**

1. **When did I first learn about this?**
   - If it was recent (within days/weeks), you might be experiencing frequency illusion

2. **Is there a logical reason this would actually increase right now?**
   - Consider news cycles, seasonal trends, or genuine market changes vs. your newfound awareness

3. **Do others who knew about this before me notice the same increase?**
   - Ask someone familiar with the topic if they've seen it more frequently lately

# 5. How to Counteract

**Practical Steps to Counter Frequency Illusion:**

**Seek Actual Data**
- Look up real statistics, trends, or research before concluding something has increased
- Check Google Trends or news archives to see if there's genuine growth vs. your perception

**⏸️ Pause and Reflect**
- When you notice a pattern, ask: "Am I seeing this more, or noticing it more?"
- Wait a few weeks before making decisions based on perceived frequency increases

**👥 Get Outside Perspective**
- Ask friends, colleagues, or family if they've noticed the same increase
- Consult experts or long-time observers in the relevant field

**📝 Track Over Time**
- Keep a simple log for a few weeks to distinguish real patterns from perception
- Note when you first became aware vs. when you started seeing increases

** Accept the Illusion**
- Recognize that this bias is normal and doesn't mean you're wrong about everything
- Use it as a reminder to verify patterns before making important decisions based on them
