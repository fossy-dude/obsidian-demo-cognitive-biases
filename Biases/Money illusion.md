# 1. ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5)

 Imagine you have $5 to buy candy. Last year, that $5 could buy 10 pieces of your favorite candy. This year, because prices went up, that same $5 can only buy 8 pieces.

But if your boss gives you a $1 raise (so now you have $6), you might feel richer - even though you still can't buy as much candy as you could last year!

Money illusion is when you focus on the number of dollars you have instead of what those dollars can actually buy. It's like thinking having a bigger number means you're richer, even if that number can't buy as much stuff! 💰

## 1.1. Recognizing the Bias

️ **You might be experiencing this bias when:**

- You feel richer after getting a raise, even if prices have risen more than your salary
- You focus on the dollar amount rather than purchasing power
- You're happy with a 2% raise when inflation is 3%
- You compare prices today to what you remember paying years ago
- You think "back in my day" prices were cheaper without adjusting for inflation
- You feel good about nominal gains that are actually losses in real terms
- You make financial decisions based on face value rather than real value

**Key phrases that signal money illusion thinking:**
- "I make more money than I used to"
- "Things are so expensive these days"
- "Back in my day, this only cost..."
- "I got a raise, so I'm doing better"
- "Prices keep going up"

## 1.2. How It Shows Up

### 1.2.1. **Workplace Examples**

- **Salary satisfaction**: Employees feel underpaid when comparing nominal salaries to other companies, ignoring differences in cost of living
- **Raise perceptions**: Workers are happier with a 3% raise during 5% inflation than with a 1% cut during 1% inflation
- **Job offers**: Candidates accept lower-paying jobs in expensive cities because the nominal salary sounds higher
- **Bonus calculations**: Companies structure bonuses in nominal terms that look impressive but lose value to inflation

### 1.2.2. **Daily Life Examples**

- **Gas price complaints**: People complain about high gas prices while ignoring that wages have also increased
- **Housing nostalgia**: Homeowners remember buying their house for $50,000 but forget that wages were much lower then
- **Coffee costs**: People grumble about $5 coffee while earning far more than they did when coffee was $1
- **Restaurant tipping**: People tip based on the bill total without considering inflation in service costs

### 1.2.3. **Financial Examples**

- **Investment returns**: Investors celebrate 5% returns during 6% inflation as if they made money
- **Loan decisions**: People focus on nominal interest rates rather than real rates adjusted for inflation
- **Retirement planning**: Savers calculate how much they need based on today's prices without projecting future inflation
- **Real estate decisions**: Buyers focus on nominal price appreciation rather than real returns after inflation

## 1.3. Quick Test

**Scenario 1**: You get a 4% raise, but inflation is 6%. How has your financial situation actually changed?
A) You're 4% better off
B) You're 2% worse off
C) You're about the same

**Scenario 2**: Your house is worth $500,000 today, up from $300,000 10 years ago. If inflation averaged 3% annually, what happened to your house's real value?
A) It went up significantly
B) It stayed about the same in real terms
C) It actually decreased in value

**Scenario 3**: You have $10,000 in a savings account earning 1% interest while inflation is 2%. What's happening to your money?
A) It's growing slowly
B) It's losing value over time
C) It's staying stable

## 1.4. How to Counteract

### 1.4.1. **Immediate Strategies**

- **Think in real terms**: Always subtract inflation from nominal gains
- **Use inflation calculators**: Convert historical prices to today's dollars
- **Focus on purchasing power**: Ask "What can this money actually buy?"
- **Compare real wages**: Look at salary increases relative to inflation

### 1.4.2. 🛠️ **Long-term Habits**

- **Track inflation**: Stay aware of current and historical inflation rates
- **Educate yourself**: Learn about real vs. nominal economic concepts

- **Practice real return calculations**: Always account for inflation in investment returns

### 1.4.3. **Workplace Applications**

- **Compensation analysis**: Evaluate salary offers using cost-of-living adjustments
- **Business planning**: Use real dollars rather than nominal figures in forecasts
- **Employee communications**: Explain raises in real terms, not just nominal percentages
- **Pricing strategies**: Consider inflation when setting prices and evaluating costs

### 1.4.4. 💡 **Daily Practice**

- **Check inflation data**: Look up current inflation rates regularly
- **Convert to today's dollars**: Use online calculators to compare historical prices
- **Think in baskets**: Consider what a fixed amount could buy at different times
- **Avoid nominal comparisons**: Don't compare dollar amounts across time periods

**Quick Test Answers:**
1) B - You're 2% worse off (4% raise - 6% inflation = -2% real change)
2) B - It stayed about the same in real terms (nominal gain roughly matched inflation)
3) B - It's losing value over time (1% return - 2% inflation = -1% real return)

Remember: Don't be fooled by the numbers on the price tag! What matters is what your money can actually buy - not how many dollars you have. 💡
