# 1. ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5)

 Imagine you're trying to remember a list of words: "cat, dog, bird, fish, sun". You might remember "sun" best because it was last.

But what if after the list, someone plays a loud "BEEP!" sound? Suddenly, you might have trouble remembering "sun" - even though it was the last word you needed to remember!

The suffix effect is like having a distractor that erases your memory of the last thing you heard. It's as if someone quickly draws over the last line of your picture before you can remember what it was.

## 1.1. Recognizing the Bias

Ô∏è **You might be experiencing this bias when:**

- You can't remember the last thing someone said if there was a sudden noise afterward
- You forget the end of a sentence when someone interrupts
- You have trouble recalling the final point in a presentation if there's background music
- Your memory of recent information gets wiped by unrelated sounds or events
- You notice you remember the beginning of things better than the end when there are distractions
- You find yourself asking "what was that last part?" after a sudden noise

**Key phrases that signal suffix effect:**
- "What did you just say?"
- "I missed the last part"
- "Can you repeat that?"
- "The noise made me forget"
- "I was listening until that sound"

> "The suffix effect reminds us that our memory is not a perfect recording device - it's more like Etch A Sketch that can be easily shaken." - Memory Researcher

Remember: The last thing you hear might not be the last thing you remember, especially when unexpected sounds compete for your brain's attention! üéµ‚û°Ô∏è

**Key Takeaway**: The suffix effect is a normal part of how human memory works. By understanding it, you can develop strategies to protect important information from being "erased" by distracting sounds or events.
