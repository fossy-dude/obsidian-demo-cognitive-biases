# 1. ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5)

Imagine you and your friends are trying to decide what game to play. Everyone keeps talking about the games you all already know how to play, like tag and hide-and-seek. But nobody mentions the cool new game that only one friend knows about! üéÆ

Shared information bias is like that - when groups spend all their time discussing things everyone already knows, while ignoring the important new information that only some people have. It's like only eating the same foods you always eat, instead of trying new dishes that might be even better!

# 2. Recognizing the Bias

## 2.1. Key Signs to Watch For

 **Endless Echo Chamber**: You hear the same points being repeated by different group members, with everyone nodding in agreement.

**Dominant Common Knowledge**: The discussion focuses mainly on information that was in the meeting invitation or preliminary reports.

**Expert Silence**: The person with unique expertise or specialized knowledge hasn't spoken much, or their input was quickly dismissed.

**Validation Seeking**: Group members spend more time confirming what everyone already knows rather than exploring new information.

‚è∞ **Time Wasting**: The group spends excessive time discussing obvious or well-known facts while rushing through or skipping novel information.

 **Dissenting Voice Absence**: Anyone who brings up different perspectives or unknown information is interrupted or their points are not followed up.

# 3. How It Shows Up

## 3.1. Workplace Examples

- **Project Planning Meetings**: The team spends hours discussing the obvious risks everyone already knows about (budget constraints, timeline issues) while glossing over the unique technical challenges that only the engineers understand

- **Hiring Decisions**: Interviewers focus on the resume qualifications everyone can see (education, years of experience) while neglecting to discuss the unique cultural fit insights each interviewer gathered during their conversations

- **Strategy Sessions**: Leadership discusses industry trends that everyone read in the same report, ignoring the market intelligence gathered by individual team members from their specific networks

- **Crisis Management**: The team dwells on the obvious problems everyone can see (customer complaints, media attention) while failing to share the unique root cause information discovered by different investigators

## 3.2. Daily Life Scenarios

- **Family Vacation Planning**: Everyone talks about the popular destinations they all know about, while the one family member who researched unique, off-the-beaten-path locations can't get a word in

- **Group Purchasing Decisions**: Friends discussing a car purchase focus on the brand reputation and styling everyone knows, while ignoring the specific mechanical concerns raised by the friend who actually knows about cars

- **Restaurant Selection**: A group spends all their time discussing restaurants they've all been to, while the person who discovered a great new place can't steer the conversation there

- **Health Decisions**: Family members discuss the obvious lifestyle changes everyone knows about (eat better, exercise more) while ignoring the specific medical research one member has done

## 3.3. Financial Decision-Making üí∞

- **Investment Committee**: The board focuses on the well-publicized market risks everyone reads in the financial news, while neglecting the unique industry insights gathered by different analysts

- **Family Budget Planning**: The family discusses the obvious expenses everyone knows about (mortgage, utilities) while ignoring the specific tax deductions or investment opportunities only one family member researched

- **Business Partnership**: Partners discuss the general market conditions everyone is aware of, while failing to share the specific competitive intelligence each has gathered from their respective networks

- **Real Estate Investment**: The investment group focuses on the neighborhood statistics everyone can look up online, while ignoring the specific local development knowledge one member has from living in the area

# 4. Quick Test

## 4.1. Self-Assessment Questions

1. **The Novelty Test**: How much time in your last group discussion was spent on information that at least one person didn't know before the meeting? (Less than 20% indicates bias)

2. **The Expert Utilization**: Did the person(s) with unique expertise or specialized knowledge get adequate airtime, or were they interrupted or their contributions minimized?

3. **The Echo Detection**: How many times did you hear the same information repeated by different group members without adding new insights? (More than 3-4 times suggests bias)

4. **The Decision Quality**: After the decision was made, did you discover important information that should have been considered but wasn't discussed?

5. **The Minority Voice**: Were perspectives that differed from the group consensus thoroughly explored, or were they quickly dismissed or ignored?

**Scoring**: If you answered "yes" to more than two of these questions, your group likely experienced shared information bias.

## 4.2. Group Process Red Flags

**Meeting Dominance**: One or two people (usually those with shared information) do most of the talking

**Information Redundancy**: The same facts and points are repeated multiple times without new insights

**Expert Underutilization**: Subject matter experts are present but their unique knowledge isn't sought or valued

**Premature Consensus**: The group quickly reaches agreement without exploring diverse perspectives

**Post-Meeting Surprises**: Important information emerges after the meeting that "should have been discussed"

**Decision Regret**: Group members later realize they missed crucial information that was available but not shared

# 5. How to Counteract

## 5.1. Ô∏è **Structural Intervention Strategies**

### 5.1.1. **Meeting Design & Facilitation**

- **Pre-meeting information sharing**: Require all participants to submit their unique information and perspectives before the meeting
- **Round-robin format**: Use structured speaking protocols to ensure everyone contributes their unique knowledge
- **Devil's advocate assignment**: Designate someone specifically to challenge assumptions and bring up alternative perspectives
- **Information inventory**: Start meetings by creating a comprehensive list of all available information, identifying what's shared vs. unique

### 5.1.2. **Role-Based Information Management**

- **Expert recognition**: Identify and acknowledge subject matter experts before discussion begins
- **Unique perspective solicitation**: Directly ask each person: "What information do you have that others might not know?"
- **Information categorization**: Group information into "shared," "partially shared," and "unique" categories

**Remember**: Shared information bias is natural and common - we're drawn to the comfort and validation of shared knowledge. The goal isn't to eliminate shared information entirely, but to balance it with the unique insights that lead to better decisions.

**Key Insight**: The best decisions come from groups that effectively integrate both shared common knowledge and unique individual insights. By creating structures and processes that value diverse perspectives, you can turn the tendency toward shared information bias into a strength that leads to more comprehensive and effective decision-making.
