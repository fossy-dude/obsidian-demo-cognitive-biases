# 1. In-Group Favoritism

## 1.1. ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5)

Imagine you're playing on a team with your friends. You naturally want your friends to win, right? In-group favoritism is like that - we tend to like, trust, and help people who are in our "group" more than people outside our group, even if the outsiders are just as good or better.

## 1.2. Recognizing the Bias

**Warning Signs to Watch For:**
- Automatically trusting people from your background more than others
- Making excuses for in-group members' mistakes but criticizing outsiders for similar issues
- Feeling uncomfortable or defensive when someone from outside your group joins your team
- Assuming people from your group are more competent or qualified
- Using phrases like "our people" or "people like us" when making decisions
- Feeling immediate connection or suspicion based on group membership alone

## 1.3. How It Shows Up

### 1.3.1. **Workplace Examples:**

- **Hiring Bias:** A manager automatically prefers candidates from their alma mater, even when others have better qualifications
- **Project Assignments:** Team leaders consistently assign important projects to employees they personally relate to or share backgrounds with
- **Promotion Decisions:** Leaders promoting people who remind them of themselves rather than the most deserving candidates

### 1.3.2. **Daily Life Examples:**

- **Social Circles:** Only inviting neighbors from your cultural background to community events
- **Parent Groups:** Parents at school events naturally gravitating toward families similar to theirs
- **Local Preferences:** Choosing to shop at businesses owned by people from your ethnic group over potentially better options

### 1.3.3. **Financial Decision Examples:**

- **Investment Choices:** Preferring to invest with advisors who share your background over those with better track records
- **Business Partnerships:** Selecting vendors or partners from your social network instead of seeking the best value
- **Banking Decisions:** Choosing financial institutions based on who works there rather than rates and fees

### 1.3.4. **Decision-Making Impact:**

- **Team Building:** Forming teams with similar people instead of diverse skill sets
- **Problem Solving:** Consulting only in-group members for solutions, missing outside perspectives
- **Resource Allocation:** Distributing resources unfairly based on group membership rather than need or merit

## 1.4. Quick Test

**Self-Check Questions:**
1. When meeting someone new, do you find yourself immediately more comfortable if they share your background?
2. Have you ever given someone the "benefit of the doubt" primarily because they reminded you of yourself?
3. Do you catch yourself thinking "they just don't get it" about people from different groups?

**Decision Review:**
- Before making important decisions, ask: "Would I make the same choice if this person were from a different background?"
- Count how many people you consult who are different from you vs. similar to you
- Review your last three significant decisions - did group membership play a role?

## 1.5. How to Counteract

### 1.5.1. **Immediate Actions:**

- **Pause and Question:** When you feel an automatic preference, stop and ask "Is this based on merit or group membership?"
- **Seek Diverse Input:** Intentionally consult people from different backgrounds before making decisions
- **Blind Evaluations:** Use anonymous reviews or evaluations when possible to remove group identity factors

### 1.5.2. **Systematic Changes:**

- **Diverse Networks:** Actively build relationships with people from different groups and backgrounds
- **Merit-Based Criteria:** Establish clear, objective criteria for decisions and stick to them
- **Reverse Thinking:** Ask "What if the roles were reversed?" or "What would an outsider recommend?"

### 1.5.3. **Long-Term Strategies:**

- **Exposure Therapy:** Regularly expose yourself to different groups and perspectives through travel, reading, or community events
- **Accountability Partners:** Ask someone from a different background to review your important decisions
- **Bias Training:** Participate in unconscious bias training and practice recognizing your own patterns

**Remember:** Everyone has in-group preferences. The goal isn't to eliminate them entirely but to recognize when they're influencing important decisions and consciously choose fairness over familiarity.
