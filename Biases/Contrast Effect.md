# 1. ELI5

The contrast effect is like when you put a small dog next to a really big dog - the small dog looks even smaller than it really is! Our brains compare things to what's around them, so something seems better or worse depending on what we see it next to. It's not about how good or bad something actually is, but how different it looks compared to other things.

# 2. Recognizing the Bias

**Warning Signs:**
- Ô∏è Making quick judgments after seeing extreme examples
- Ô∏è Feeling like something is "amazing" or "terrible" right after seeing its opposite
- Ô∏è Comparing current options to recent experiences instead of objective standards
- Ô∏è Your opinion changes dramatically based on the order you see things
- Ô∏è Using superlatives like "best ever" or "worst ever" frequently
- Ô∏è Making decisions based on relative comparisons rather than absolute value

# 3. How Bias Shows Up

**Workplace Examples:**
- After reviewing an outstanding resume, a good candidate seems mediocre
- Following a brilliant presentation, an average one feels inadequate
- Comparing new hires to your best employee rather than job requirements
- Salary negotiations feel unfair when you know someone else got a better deal

**Daily Life Examples:**
- A room feels cold after coming in from freezing weather
- Food tastes bland after eating something very spicy
- A car seems slow after driving a sports car
- Your phone feels outdated after seeing the latest model

**Financial Examples:**
- A $500 expense seems reasonable after looking at a $2,000 item
- Stock market gains feel disappointing compared to previous highs
- A 5% raise feels inadequate if your colleague got 10%
- Investment choices look different after seeing extreme market movements

**Shopping Examples:**
- The middle-priced option seems like the best value when shown with expensive and cheap alternatives
- A "sale" price looks good compared to the original (inflated) price
- Premium products seem worth it when placed next to budget options

# 4. Quick Test or Checklist

**Ask yourself these questions:**
- Am I comparing this to a recent extreme experience rather than evaluating it on its own merits?
- Would my opinion change if I saw this in a different order or context?
- Am I using absolute criteria or just relative comparisons?
- Did I form my judgment quickly, or did I take time to consider objectively?
- Would someone else who hasn't seen what I just saw evaluate this differently?

# 5. How to Counteract

**Immediate Actions:**
- ‚è∏Ô∏è **Pause and reset** - Take a break between evaluations to clear your mental frame of reference
- üìù **Use objective criteria** - Create checklists and standards before seeing options
- üî¢ **Evaluate independently** - Assess each item on its own before comparing
- üë• **Get multiple perspectives** - Ask others who haven't seen the same context

**Systemic Approaches:**
- **Establish baselines** - Define what "good" looks like before starting evaluations
- **Randomize order** - Mix up the sequence you review things to avoid order effects
- **Use absolute scales** - Rate items on fixed scales (1-10) rather than relative rankings
- ‚è∞ **Add time gaps** - Space out evaluations to let contrast effects fade

**Long-term Strategies:**
- **Develop awareness** - Learn to spot contrast effects in your daily decisions
- üìö **Study benchmarks** - Understand industry standards and objective measures
- ü§î **Practice delayed judgment** - Wait before making important decisions after seeing extreme examples
- üìã **Create decision frameworks** - Use structured approaches for consistent evaluations
