# 1. ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5)

 Imagine someone asks you if you like their new haircut, and you think it looks terrible, but you say "It looks great!" anyway because you don't want to hurt their feelings.

Courtesy bias is when we tell people what they want to hear instead of what we really think, just to be nice and avoid making anyone upset or uncomfortable. It's like wearing a social mask to keep everyone happy! 😊

## 1.1. Recognizing the Bias

️ **You might be experiencing this bias when:**

- You catch yourself saying "that's nice" when you actually disagree
- You agree with someone just to avoid conflict
- You give vague, non-committal answers to sensitive questions
- You notice your true opinion differs from what you publicly express
- You feel uncomfortable sharing honest feedback
- You worry about hurting someone's feelings more than being truthful

**Key phrases that signal courtesy bias:**
- "That's interesting..." (when you actually disagree)
- "I can see why you'd think that" (but you don't agree)
- "Maybe..." (instead of a clear yes/no)
- "It's not bad..." (when it actually is)
- "Everyone's entitled to their opinion" (to avoid debate)

## 1.2. How It Shows Up

### 1.2.1. **Workplace Examples**

- **Performance reviews**: Giving overly positive feedback to avoid demotivating employees

- **Client meetings**: Agreeing with unreasonable requests to keep the client happy
- **Team decisions**: Going along with group consensus even when you have concerns
- **Interview feedback**: Softening criticism to avoid burning bridges

### 1.2.2. **Daily Life Examples**

- **Social gatherings**: Pretending to enjoy food you dislike at someone's home
- **Gift receiving**: Acting enthusiastic about gifts you don't like or need
- **Relationship advice**: Telling friends what they want to hear rather than hard truths
- **Political discussions**: Avoiding controversial topics to keep conversations pleasant
- **Parenting**: Not addressing children's behavior issues to avoid conflict

### 1.2.3. **Financial Examples**

Remember: Being kind and being honest aren't mutually exclusive! The goal is to find the sweet spot where your truth serves others, not just your need to be right.

The most effective feedback balances compassion with candor - it's not about choosing between being nice and being honest, but about being both at the same time. 🌟
