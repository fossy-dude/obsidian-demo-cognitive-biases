# 1. ELI5

The Mere Exposure Effect is like developing a taste for a song you hear on the radio all the time - the more you encounter something, the more you tend to like it, even if you didn't care about it initially. Our brains are wired to feel more comfortable with familiar things, so repeated exposure to people, ideas, brands, or choices makes us prefer them over new alternatives. It's why that catchy jingle gets stuck in your head and suddenly you're craving that specific brand of cereal.

# 2. Recognizing the Bias

- **Automatic preference for familiar options** - Choosing the same restaurant, route, or brand without considering alternatives
- **Dismissing new ideas quickly** - Feeling skeptical or resistant to unfamiliar concepts before giving them fair consideration
- **Gravitating toward known faces** - Preferring to work with or trust people you've interacted with before, even briefly
- **Comfort with routine** - Feeling anxious or uncomfortable when familiar patterns are disrupted
- **Brand loyalty without rational reasons** - Sticking with products or services simply because you've used them before
- **Overvaluing past experiences** - Giving more weight to previous encounters than their actual relevance to current decisions
- **Resistance to change** - Defaulting to "the way we've always done it" without evaluating if it's still the best approach

# 3. How Bias Shows Up

**üõí Shopping & Consumer Choices**
- Buying the same brands repeatedly without comparing prices or quality
- Choosing familiar restaurant chains over local options when traveling
- Preferring songs you've heard before on streaming platforms
- Selecting movies with actors you recognize over unknown talent

**Workplace Decisions**
- Hiring candidates from familiar schools or companies
- Using the same software tools without exploring newer, potentially better alternatives
- Assigning projects to team members you've worked with before
- Sticking with vendors or suppliers based on past relationships rather than current performance

**üèõÔ∏è Political & Social Preferences**
- Supporting political candidates whose names you recognize from yard signs or ads
- Trusting news sources you've consumed regularly, regardless of their accuracy
- Preferring social media content from accounts you follow frequently
- Developing positive feelings toward people you see regularly (coworkers, neighbors, gym-goers)

**Financial Decisions**
- Investing in companies whose products you use daily
- Choosing banks or credit cards based on name recognition rather than terms
- Staying with insurance providers despite better deals being available
- Following investment advice from familiar financial personalities

# 4. Quick Test or Checklist

Ask yourself these three questions when making choices:

1. **Am I choosing this because it's familiar?** - "Would I still pick this option if I encountered it for the first time today?"
2. **Have I considered alternatives recently?** - "When was the last time I actively compared this choice to other available options?"
3. **What would an outsider recommend?** - "If someone with no prior exposure to these options had to decide, what would they choose based purely on merit?"

# 5. How to Counteract

** Actively Seek Alternatives**
- Set regular "exploration days" where you deliberately try new options (restaurants, routes, products)
- Create a rule to research at least 2-3 alternatives before making familiar choices
- Ask friends or colleagues for recommendations outside your usual preferences

**Use Objective Criteria**
- Make lists of what actually matters for your decision (price, quality, convenience, etc.)
- Score options based on these criteria rather than familiarity
- Research options without looking at brand names first

**üïê Implement Waiting Periods**
- For significant decisions, sleep on it and revisit your choice the next day
- Use the "10-10-10 rule": How will I feel about this choice in 10 minutes, 10 months, and 10 years?
- Set calendar reminders to periodically review and challenge your default choices

** Get Outside Perspectives**
- Ask people with different backgrounds or experiences for their input
- Consult online reviews and comparisons from diverse sources
- Join communities or forums where people discuss alternatives to your usual choices

**üìù Document Your Reasoning**
- Write down why you're making a choice - this forces you to think beyond "it feels right"
- Keep a decision journal to review whether familiarity influenced past choices
- Before important decisions, list pros and cons of both familiar and unfamiliar options
