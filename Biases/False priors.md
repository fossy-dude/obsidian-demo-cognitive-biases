# 1. ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5)

Imagine you believe all cats are mean because you once met a mean cat. Now when you meet a friendly cat, you might think "this cat is just pretending to be nice" or "this cat is unusual" instead of realizing that most cats are actually friendly! That's False Priors - your brain uses what you already believe instead of looking at what's really happening right now.

It's like wearing glasses that change how you see everything. If your glasses are red-tinted, you'll think everything has a red tint, even if it's actually blue! Your beliefs work like these glasses - they make you see the world in a certain way, even when the evidence shows something different.

Think about it like this: if you're absolutely sure that your favorite superhero is the strongest, you might ignore evidence that another superhero is actually stronger. You'd find excuses why the evidence is wrong instead of changing your mind about your favorite!

# 2. Recognizing the Bias

**Warning Signs to Watch For:**
- Ô∏è You become defensive when your beliefs are challenged
- You only look for evidence that supports what you already believe
- ‚ùå You dismiss contradictory evidence as "flawed" or "irrelevant"
- You find excuses why information that contradicts your beliefs must be wrong
- You interpret ambiguous information to support your existing views
- üò§ You feel threatened when people present different perspectives
- You remember facts that support your beliefs better than those that don't
- üîá You avoid people or sources that disagree with you
- You jump to conclusions based on your initial assumptions
- You can't imagine how your beliefs could possibly be wrong

# 3. How It Shows Up

## 3.1. **Workplace Examples**

**Hiring and Recruitment Bias:**
- **Stereotype-Based Judgments**: Hiring managers reject qualified candidates because they don't fit their mental image of what a "good employee" looks like
- **Experience Overqualification**: Teams pass on highly skilled candidates because they assume "someone this qualified won't stay long" without evidence
- **Educational Background Bias**: Recruiters favor candidates from prestigious schools regardless of actual skills demonstrated
- **Age-Based Assumptions**: Managers make assumptions about older workers' technological abilities or younger workers' commitment levels without individual assessment

**Project Management Pitfalls:**
- **Solution Presumption**: Teams rush to implement familiar solutions without properly analyzing whether they address the actual problem
- **Technology Preference**: IT departments choose technologies based on what they're comfortable with rather than what best serves business needs
- **Timeline Optimism**: Project managers consistently underestimate timelines because they believe "this time will be different" despite historical evidence

**Remember**: The goal isn't to eliminate all prior beliefs - that's impossible and undesirable. Instead, aim to hold your beliefs lightly and be willing to update them when evidence warrants. Our prior knowledge helps us navigate the world efficiently, but we must remain open to revising our understanding as we learn.

**Key Insight**: The wisest people aren't those who are always right, but those who have the best processes for updating their beliefs when they're wrong. False priors are natural and universal - what matters is developing the intellectual humility and critical thinking skills to recognize when our beliefs need updating based on new evidence.
