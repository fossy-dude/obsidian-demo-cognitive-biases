# 1. ELI5

Imagine you're trying to make your LEGO tower taller, and you just keep adding more and more blocks to the top without noticing that the whole thing is getting wobbly and might fall over. Additive bias is when people always think the solution to a problem is to add more things—more features, more steps, more rules, more stuff—when sometimes the best solution is actually to take things away or simplify. We're so focused on "what can we add?" that we rarely ask "what can we remove?"

# 2. Recognizing the Bias

**Warning Signs of Additive Bias:**

- Your first instinct when facing a problem is "what can we add?" rather than "what can we remove?"
- You suggest adding new features, steps, or processes without considering simplification
- You feel uncomfortable with the idea of removing elements that exist, even if they're not essential
- You believe more complexity equals more sophistication or value
- You rarely ask "what would happen if we took this away?" when evaluating systems
- You notice that your solutions tend to increase in size, scope, or complexity over time
- You feel that adding something demonstrates more effort or contribution than removing something
- You overlook simple solutions because they don't feel "substantial enough"
- You create new rules or procedures instead of eliminating existing ones that are problematic
- You judge proposals based on how much they add rather than how much they improve through simplification

# 3. How Bias Shows Up

**Workplace Scenarios**
- Software teams constantly adding new features instead of fixing bugs or improving existing ones
- Companies adding more management layers when communication problems could be solved by flattening structure
- Adding more meetings to solve communication issues instead of improving existing meeting quality
- Creating new policies when existing ones just need better enforcement or simplification

**Daily Life Examples**
- Buying more storage containers instead of decluttering and getting rid of items you don't need
- Adding more apps to organize your life instead of simplifying and reducing commitments
- Installing more security systems in your house instead of just locking doors and windows properly
- Taking more supplements instead of improving diet and exercise fundamentals

**Financial Consequences**
- Adding more investment accounts instead of simplifying and optimizing existing ones
- Purchasing new organization tools and systems instead of developing better habits with what you have
- Buying more insurance policies instead of understanding and optimizing existing coverage
- Expanding business offerings instead of improving core products and services

**Professional Impact**
- Adding more bullet points to resumes instead of refining and strengthening key achievements
- Creating more slides for presentations instead of improving the quality and clarity of existing ones
- Adding more team members to solve productivity issues instead of addressing workflow problems
- Implementing more software tools instead of mastering and optimizing existing ones

# 4. Quick Test or Checklist

**Additive Bias Self-Check:**

1. **The Subtraction Test**: "When I considered solutions to my last few problems, did I ever seriously ask 'what can I remove or simplify?' or did I only think about what to add?"
2. **The Complexity Test**: "Have my recent solutions made things more complex, larger, or more complicated? Could the same problems have been solved by removing something instead?"
3. **The 'Why Not Less?' Test**: "When someone suggests a simpler solution with fewer elements, do I find myself thinking it's not enough or not substantial enough, even if it would work?"

**Quick Assessment**: If you primarily think in terms of adding elements and rarely consider subtraction, or if you feel that more complex solutions are inherently better, you're likely influenced by additive bias.

**Impact Scale**:
- **Mild**: Occasionally defaulting to addition without major negative consequences
- **Moderate**: Regularly creating unnecessary complexity in solutions and systems
- **Severe**: Almost never considering simplification, leading to highly complex and inefficient outcomes

# 5. How to Counteract

**️ Strategies to Combat Additive Bias:**

**Immediate Actions (Start Today):**
- **Practice the "Subtraction First" Rule**: Before considering additions, always ask "what can we remove or simplify?"
- **Implement "One In, One Out"**: When adding something new, commit to removing something existing
- **Conduct Complexity Audits**: Regularly review your systems, processes, and possessions to identify unnecessary elements
- **Challenge the "More is Better" Assumption**: Ask "would this be simpler and still work?" for every addition

**Short-term Improvements (This Week):**
- **Study Minimalist Principles**: Learn from minimalist design, lifestyle, and business approaches
- **Practice Constraint-Based Thinking**: Set artificial limits (e.g., "solve this with half the resources") to force creative subtraction
- **Seek Subtractive Examples**: Look for cases where removing elements improved outcomes
- **Value Simplicity Publicly**: Praise and reward simplification efforts in yourself and others

**Long-term Solutions (Ongoing):**
- **Develop a "Subtraction Mindset"**: Train yourself to see subtraction as equally valid and valuable as addition
- **Build Systems for Regular Simplification**: Schedule regular reviews to remove unnecessary elements from all areas of life
- **Study Success Cases**: Research examples where simplicity outperformed complexity (e.g., successful minimalist companies, elegant solutions)
- **Create Cultural Change**: Encourage teams and organizations to value simplification and reward subtractive thinking
- **Practice Mindful Consumption**: Before acquiring anything new, ask what you can remove to make space
