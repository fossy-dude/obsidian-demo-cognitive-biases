# 1. ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5)

Imagine you and your friends are deciding how many cookies to share. If you were alone, you might want 2 cookies. But when everyone talks together, you all start saying "Let's take 5 cookies!" and everyone gets more excited about taking more cookies. Groupshift is when people in a group make more extreme decisions than they would make alone - either much more careful or much more risky.

# 2. Recognizing the Bias

Groupshift occurs when group discussions push decisions toward more extreme positions. Key signs include:

- **Risk amplification**: Groups often make riskier decisions than individuals
- **Cautious extremes**: Sometimes groups become overly conservative
- **Polarization**: Views become more one-sided after discussion
- **Shared responsibility**: Diffusion of individual accountability
- **Emotional contagion**: Excitement or fear spreads through the group

# 3. How It Shows Up

## 3.1. Workplace Scenarios

- **Project planning**: Team commits to unrealistic deadlines that no individual would accept alone
- **Budget decisions**: Group approves spending far beyond initial individual comfort levels
- **Risk assessment**: Team downplays potential dangers after persuasive discussion
- **Innovation**: Groups either become overly optimistic about new ideas or excessively conservative

## 3.2. Daily Life Examples

- **Social media**: Online groups reinforce extreme views through echo chambers
- **Family decisions**: Vacation plans become much more elaborate or expensive after group discussion
- **Friend groups**: Peer pressure leading to more extreme behaviors than individuals would choose
- **Community meetings**: Neighborhood decisions swing to extremes after heated debates

## 3.3. Financial Context üí∞

- **Investment clubs**: Groups make riskier investments than members would personally choose
- **Business partnerships**: Companies take on more debt than individual owners would accept
- **Market bubbles**: Collective enthusiasm drives prices beyond rational levels
- **Retirement planning**: Group settings influence people to choose much more aggressive or conservative strategies

# 4. Quick Test üìù

**Ask yourself:**
1. Would I make this same decision if I were completely alone?
2. Is my position more extreme now than when the discussion started?
3. Am I feeling pressure to agree with the group's direction?
4. Would I be comfortable explaining this decision to someone outside the group?
5. Has anyone in the group raised concerns that were quickly dismissed?

**If you answered "yes" to questions 2-3, or "no" to questions 1, 4, or 5, you may be experiencing Groupshift.**

# 5. How to Counteract Ô∏è

## 5.1. Before Group Discussions

- **Write individual decisions first**: Have everyone document their position privately before group discussion
- **Assign devil's advocates**: Rotate responsibility for challenging the group consensus
- **Set decision criteria**: Establish objective standards before emotions run high
- **Consider alternatives**: Require multiple options to be evaluated, not just yes/no

## 5.2. During Group Discussions

- **Encourage dissent**: Explicitly ask for opposing viewpoints and concerns
- **Take breaks**: Allow time for individual reflection between group discussions
- **Use anonymous polling**: Gather private input to reduce social pressure
- **Focus on facts**: Keep discussions anchored to data and objective criteria

## 5.3. After Group Decisions

- **Review individually**: Re-evaluate the decision independently the next day
- **Seek external input**: Consult with people outside the group for fresh perspective
- **Document reasoning**: Keep clear records of how and why decisions were made
- **Plan for monitoring**: Establish checkpoints to review if the decision needs adjustment

**Remember**: Good group decisions leverage collective wisdom without falling into collective extremism. The goal is to find the sweet spot between individual judgment and group input.
