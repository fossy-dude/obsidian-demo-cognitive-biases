# 1. ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5)

Imagine you have a favorite toy car that you think is the fastest. When you race it against other cars, you only remember the times your car won and forget when it lost. That's confirmation bias - we only notice and remember things that prove what we already believe, like wearing special glasses that only show us what we want to see.

Imagine you have a favorite superhero. When someone tells you something awesome about them, you get super excited and remember it forever! But if someone says something not-so-great, you might forget it quickly or think "they don't know what they're talking about."

Confirmation bias is like being your superhero's biggest fan - your brain loves to notice and remember things that prove you're right, while ignoring things that might show you're wrong. It's like your brain has a favorite team and only cheers for the plays that make your team look good!

**Remember**: The goal isn't to eliminate confirmation bias entirely - that's impossible for humans. Instead, aim to develop awareness and create systems that counteract its natural tendency. True wisdom comes not from being right, but from having processes that help you become less wrong over time.

**Key Insight**: The most successful people aren't those who are always right, but those who have the best processes for updating their beliefs when they're wrong. Confirmation bias is your mind's attempt to protect you, but sometimes the best protection comes from seeing the world as it truly is, not as you wish it were.
