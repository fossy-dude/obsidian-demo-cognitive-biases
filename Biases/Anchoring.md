# 1. ELI5

Imagine the first number you hear in a negotiation is like dropping an anchor in the ocean‚Äîit gets stuck in your mind and everything else gets measured against it. If someone asks "Is this car worth $20,000?" your brain automatically uses $20,000 as the starting point, even if the car is actually worth much less or more. We get "anchored" to the first piece of information we receive and have trouble moving away from it when making decisions.

# 2. Recognizing the Bias

**Warning Signs of Anchoring:**

- You keep referring back to the first number, price, or piece of information mentioned
- Your final decision stays suspiciously close to the initial suggestion, even after new information
- You feel resistant to moving far from the original reference point
- You dismiss information that contradicts the first impression or initial data
- In negotiations, you notice both sides clustering around the first offer made
- You judge performance, quality, or value primarily compared to the first example you encountered
- You struggle to imagine alternatives that differ significantly from the initial proposal

# 3. How Bias Shows Up

**Negotiation & Price Setting**
- A seller lists a house for $500K. Even after discovering structural issues, buyers still think in the $450K-$480K range instead of considering the true market value might be $350K
- In salary negotiations, the first number mentioned heavily influences the final agreement, regardless of market research done afterward

**üë• Performance & First Impressions**
- An employee makes a great first impression in month one. Six months later, managers still rate their average work as "above average" compared to colleagues who started poorly
- Restaurant reviews: if the first dish is amazing, diners rate the entire meal higher, even if subsequent courses are mediocre

** Investment & Financial Decisions**
- A stock was trading at $100 last year. Even though fundamentals have changed, investors anchor to that price and think $80 is "cheap" without analyzing current value
- Credit card companies set high credit limits as anchors, making people feel comfortable spending more than they should

**üè∑Ô∏è Product Pricing & Value Perception**
- "Was $199, now $99!" makes $99 seem like a bargain, even when competitors sell similar items for $79
- Menu engineering: placing a $40 steak next to a $28 chicken makes the chicken seem reasonably priced

# 4. Quick Test or Checklist

**Anchoring Bias Self-Check:**

1. **The Reference Point Test**: "What was the first number, price, or piece of information I encountered about this decision? Am I still thinking about it?"
2. **The Range Test**: "If I ignore the initial information completely, what range of outcomes would I consider reasonable? How different is this from my current thinking?"
3. **The Alternative Sources Test**: "Have I actively sought out different starting points or reference frames from completely independent sources before deciding?"

**Quick Check**: If your answer to question 1 is "yes" and your answers to questions 2 and 3 reveal you haven't explored alternatives, you're likely anchored!

# 5. How to Counteract

**Ô∏è Defense Strategies Against Anchoring:**

**Before Making Decisions:**
- **Set Your Own Anchor First**: Research and establish your own reference points before hearing others' suggestions or seeing posted prices
- **Use Multiple Starting Points**: Deliberately seek 3-5 different initial references from varied, independent sources
- **Practice "Anchor Awareness"**: Before each negotiation or major decision, remind yourself to watch for the first number mentioned

**During Negotiations:**
- **Counter-Anchor Strategy**: If someone throws out a number first, immediately respond with your own anchor from the opposite end of a reasonable range
- **Ask "How Did You Arrive at That?"**: Force others to justify their initial positions rather than accepting them as starting points
- **Take a Break**: Step away after hearing initial offers to let the anchor's influence fade

**For Better Decision-Making:**
- **Consider the Opposite**: Actively ask "What would I think if the first information had been completely different?"
- **Use External Standards**: Research industry benchmarks, market rates, or historical data as objective reference points
- **Sleep on It**: Major decisions benefit from time, which naturally weakens the anchor's psychological grip
