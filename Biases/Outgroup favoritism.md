# 1. ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5)

Imagine you're playing with red and blue blocks. You only have red blocks, but you notice that all the kids with blue blocks get to use them more and get praised more. Even though the red blocks are yours, you start thinking the blue blocks are better and you wish you had blue blocks instead.

Outgroup favoritism is when people who are part of a group that gets treated unfairly start believing that other groups are better than their own group.

# 2. Recognizing the Bias

Outgroup favoritism occurs when members of disadvantaged or marginalized groups develop positive attitudes, preferences, or admiration for groups that have higher status or privilege, sometimes at the expense of their own group identity.

**Key Warning Signs You're Experiencing This Bias:**

- "People from [privileged group] are just more professional/competent/sophisticated"
- "I wish I was more like [people from dominant group] instead of like my own community"

- "If I act more like [dominant group], I'll be more successful/accepted"

**Behavioral Indicators:**
- You downplay or distance yourself from your cultural/ethnic background
- You prefer to associate with people from higher-status groups over your own
- You adopt the accent, mannerisms, or preferences of dominant groups
- You criticize your own group more harshly than other groups
- You feel embarrassed by aspects of your own culture or community

**️ Emotional Red Flags:**
- Feeling ashamed or embarrassed about your background when around certain groups
- Experiencing internal conflict between your identity and societal messages
- Feeling relieved when people don't immediately recognize your group membership

**The Value Assessment**: "What unique strengths and values does my group offer that I might be overlooking?"
