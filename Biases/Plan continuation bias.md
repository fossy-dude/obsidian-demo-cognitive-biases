# 1. ELI5

Imagine you're following a treasure map, but suddenly you reach a dangerous cliff! üó∫Ô∏èÔ∏è Plan continuation bias is like insisting "But the map says go this way!" instead of finding a safer path. It's when people stick to their original plan even when everything around them has changed and the plan no longer makes sense.

# 2. Recognizing the Bias

**Critical Warning Signs:**
- **Ignoring new information:** Dismissing or downplaying data that contradicts the original plan
- **Sunk cost thinking:** "We've already invested so much, we can't stop now"
- **Rigid adherence:** Following the plan regardless of changing circumstances
- **Data cherry-picking:** Only noticing information that supports continuing the current course
- **Overconfidence:** Believing the original plan must be correct despite evidence to the contrary
- ‚è∞ **Timeline pressure:** Rushing to stick to deadlines even when quality or safety is compromised

**Behavioral Red Flags:**
- "We need to stay the course" (when conditions have fundamentally changed)
- "We've come too far to turn back now" (prioritizing past investments over future outcomes)
- "Let's just push through" (dismissing legitimate concerns or obstacles)

# 3. How Bias Shows Up

## 3.1. **Workplace Scenarios**

- **Project Management:** Continuing a failing project because "we're already 6 months in"
- **Strategic Planning:** Sticking to a 5-year strategy despite market disruptions or new competitors
- **Product Development:** Launching a product that no longer meets market needs because development is complete
- **Budget Management:** Continuing to fund underperforming departments due to initial commitments

## 3.2. **Daily Life Examples**

- **Travel Plans:** Driving through dangerous weather because "we already booked the hotel"
- **Career Paths:** Staying in an unfulfilling job because "I've invested 10 years here"
- **Relationships:** Maintaining unhealthy relationships due to time already invested
- **Home Projects:** Continuing a DIY renovation that's clearly beyond your skill level

## 3.3. **Financial Decision Making**

- **Investment Strategies:** Holding losing stocks because "I've already lost so much, can't sell now"
- **Business Ventures:** Continuing to fund a failing startup due to initial capital investment
- **Real Estate:** Completing a property purchase despite discovering major flaws
- **Education:** Pursuing an expensive degree that no longer aligns with career goals

## 3.4. **Crisis Situations**

- **Emergency Response:** Following outdated evacuation procedures during natural disasters
- **Healthcare:** Continuing with a treatment plan that's causing harmful side effects
- **Military Operations:** Persisting with battle plans despite intelligence showing changed enemy positions
- **Technology:** Using outdated software systems because "we've always done it this way"

# 4. Quick Test or Checklist

**Plan Continuation Bias Assessment:**

1. **Information Integration Test:** How do you react to data that contradicts your current plan?
   - ‚ùå Dismiss it as an outlier or exception
   - Seriously consider it and adjust plans accordingly

2. **Sunk Cost Awareness:** When encountering significant obstacles, what's your primary consideration?
   - ‚ùå "We've already invested too much to stop"
   - "What's the best decision going forward, regardless of past investments?"

3. **Environmental Scanning:** How often do you reassess whether the original assumptions still hold true?
   - ‚ùå Rarely question the original plan
   - Regularly validate that conditions match initial expectations

4. **Exit Criteria:** Do you have clear conditions under which you would abandon or significantly change the plan?
   - ‚ùå No predefined exit points or failure conditions
   - Clear thresholds for when to pivot or stop

5. **Outside Perspective:** How do you respond when others suggest changing course?
   - ‚ùå Defensive, view it as criticism of the original plan
   - Open to feedback, consider it valuable input

**Scoring:** More "‚ùå" responses indicate stronger plan continuation bias tendencies.

# 5. How to Counteract

## 5.1. **Adaptive Planning Strategies**

- **Build in regular review points:** Schedule specific times to reassess the plan's viability
- **Define exit criteria:** Establish clear conditions for abandoning or changing course
- **Create contingency plans:** Develop alternative strategies for different scenarios
- **Use pilot programs:** Test new approaches on a small scale before full commitment

## 5.2. **Data-Driven Decision Making**

- **Establish key metrics:** Define specific indicators that measure plan effectiveness
- **Set warning thresholds:** Identify early warning signs that the plan may need adjustment
- **Conduct regular reality checks:** Compare actual results against expected outcomes
- **Seek diverse data sources:** Gather information from multiple perspectives and channels

## 5.3. ü§î **Cognitive Techniques**

- **Practice zero-based thinking:** "If I were starting today, would I make the same decision?"
- **Consider opportunity costs:** Ask "What better uses could we make of these resources?"
- **Use pre-mortem analysis:** Imagine the plan has failed and work backward to identify why
- **Encourage devil's advocacy:** Assign someone to argue against continuing the current course

## 5.4. üë• **Social And Organizational Approaches**

- **Create psychological safety:** Make it acceptable to challenge existing plans
- **Use outside reviewers:** Bring in fresh perspectives without emotional attachment
- **Establish formal review processes:** Create structured opportunities for course correction
- **Reward adaptability:** Recognize and praise team members who identify needed changes

## 5.5. üõë **Specific Implementation Tools**

- **The "Stop-Loss" Rule:** Set maximum acceptable losses before starting any initiative
- **Regular Pivot Reviews:** Monthly or quarterly assessments of plan viability
- **Assumption Validation:** Regular testing of the assumptions underlying the original plan
- **Red Team Exercises:** Have a dedicated team actively look for reasons to change course

## 5.6. **Personal Development**

- **Cultivate intellectual humility:** Accept that your original plan might not be optimal
- **Practice flexible thinking:** Train yourself to see multiple paths to the same goal
- **Develop scenario planning skills:** Learn to anticipate and prepare for different outcomes
- **Build emotional resilience:** Learn to accept course changes without personal failure

**Remember:** The most successful plans aren't the ones that never change, but the ones that adapt to new realities. Flexibility is a strength, not a weakness! üåä
