# 1. ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5)

🖼️ Imagine you take a picture of your teddy bear sitting on your bed. When you look at the photo later, you might remember seeing more of the room around the bear than what was actually in the picture!

Boundary extension is like your brain playing tricks on you - it remembers seeing more space around the edges of images than you actually did see. Your brain automatically fills in the missing parts and makes you think you saw the whole scene!

# 2. Recognizing the Bias

**Warning Signs of Boundary Extension:**

- **Memory inflation**: You recall seeing more background details than were actually present
- **Scene completion**: Your mind automatically fills in missing areas around image edges
- **Context overestimation**: You remember the surrounding environment as being more extensive than it was
- **Spatial distortion**: Your memory expands the boundaries of visual scenes
- **Confidence mismatch**: You're highly confident about expanded details that weren't actually visible
- **Selective expansion**: The effect is stronger for meaningful or familiar scenes
- **Photographic surprise**: When looking at photos again, you're surprised by how cropped or tight the framing is

️ **When It's Most Likely to Occur:**

- Looking at photographs or images with tight framing
- Recalling scenes from memory versus reality
- Viewing images with meaningful or recognizable content
- When you're distracted or not paying full attention
- In familiar environments where your brain fills in expected details

# 3. How Bias Shows Up

## 3.1. 📸 **Photography & Visual Media**

- **Photo albums**: Looking at vacation photos and being surprised by how tightly cropped they are compared to your memory
- **Social media**: Posting photos and later realizing they don't capture the "full scene" you remembered
- **News images**: Remembering more context around news photos than was actually shown
- **Movie scenes**: Recalling more background detail in film scenes than was actually filmed
- **Security footage**: Witnesses remembering more of the surrounding area than what cameras captured

## 3.2. **Daily Life Experiences**

- **Home memories**: Remembering your childhood bedroom as being larger or having more visible surrounding areas
- **Real estate viewing**: Recalling more of the neighborhood around a house you toured than was actually visible
- **Restaurant experiences**: Remembering more of the restaurant's ambiance and surrounding space than you actually observed
- **Shopping**: Recalling more of the store layout and surrounding merchandise than you actually saw
- **Travel memories**: Your memory of landmarks includes more surrounding context than was actually visible from your vantage point

- **Architecture**: Remembering buildings with more surrounding space than was present in the images you viewed
- **Graphic design**: Your memory expands the boundaries of designed layouts and compositions

## 3.4. **Cognitive & Memory Research**

- **Eyewitness testimony**: Witnesses describing more background detail than was actually visible in a scene
- **Memory studies**: Research participants consistently draw recalled scenes with expanded boundaries
- **Cognitive testing**: People confidently identify details they couldn't have possibly seen based on the original image

# 4. Quick Test

## 4.1. **The Boundary Extension Self-Assessment**

**The Photo Memory Test:**
1. Look at a photo for 10 seconds, then cover it
2. After 1 minute, try to draw or describe what you saw
3. Compare your memory to the actual photo
4. Did you include details that would have been outside the frame?

**The Framing Awareness Quiz:**
Answer these questions about your visual memory:

1. When you look at photos from your phone, do you often feel like:
   - A) The photos capture exactly what you remember seeing
   - B) The photos seem more tightly cropped than your memory
   - C) You're not sure - you rarely compare photos to memories

2. Have you ever been surprised by how little background is visible in a photo compared to your memory?
   - A) Never - photos usually match my memory
   - B) Sometimes - I notice this occasionally
   - C) Frequently - I'm often surprised by photo composition

3. When describing a scene you've only seen in photos, do you find yourself including details that:
   - A) You know were definitely in the photo
   - B) You think were in the photo but aren't certain
   - C) You realize later couldn't have been visible based on the photo's framing

**The Reality Check Exercise:**
Select 5 photos from your phone or social media. For each one:
- Write down what you remember seeing
- Look at the actual photo and compare
- Note any details you "remembered" that would have been outside the frame

**Red Flag Indicators:**
- [ ] I often describe more background detail than was actually visible in photos
- [ ] I'm frequently surprised by how tightly cropped photos are compared to my memory
- [ ] I confidently describe details I couldn't have possibly seen based on image framing
- [ ] I remember scenes as being more expansive than they actually were
- [ ] I catch myself "filling in" missing areas around image edges

**Scoring:**
- 0-2 red flags: Low boundary extension susceptibility
- 3-4 red flags: Moderate susceptibility - you experience this typical cognitive effect
- 5+ red flags: High susceptibility - you may want to develop more awareness of this bias

> **Key Insight**: Boundary extension is a normal cognitive function that helps us make sense of incomplete visual information. It's not a flaw but rather a feature of how our brains construct coherent visual experiences from limited input.

**Remember**: The goal isn't to eliminate boundary extension entirely (it's a natural and often helpful cognitive process), but to develop awareness of when it might be affecting your memory or perception in ways that could be problematic.

**Final Thought**: Understanding boundary extension can help you become more accurate in your visual memories, more discerning in your observations, and more aware of the fascinating ways your brain constructs your reality from incomplete information.
